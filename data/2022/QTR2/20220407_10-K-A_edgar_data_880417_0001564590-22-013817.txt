ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. 
 REPORT ON MANAGEMENT S ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 
 The management of CSB Bancorp, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance that our published financial statements are fairly presented, in all material respects, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management conducted the required assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. Management s assessment did not identify any material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based upon this assessment, management believes that the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2021.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of CSB Bancorp, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CSB Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent, with respect to the Company, in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. 
 The communication of critical audit matters does not alter, in any way, our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Allowance for Loan Losses (ALL) Qualitative Factors 
 
 Description of the Matter 
 The Company s loan portfolio totaled 549 million as of December 31, 2021, and the associated ALL was 7.6 million. As discussed in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, determining the amount of the ALL requires significant judgment about the collectability of loans, which includes an assessment of historical loss experience within each risk category of loans, qualitative adjustment to those historical loss allocations, and testing of certain commercial loans for impairment. Management applies the additional qualitative adjustments to reflect the inherent losses that exist in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date that are not reflected in the historical loss experience. Qualitative adjustments are made based upon changes in lending policies and practices, economic conditions, changes in the loan portfolio mix, trends in loan delinquencies and classified loans, collateral values, concentrations of credit risk for the commercial loan portfolios, and specific industry exposures that are more susceptible to loss during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 We identified these qualitative adjustments within the ALL as critical audit matters because they involve a high degree of subjectivity and are highly difficult to estimate based on the uncertainty of the pandemic. In turn, auditing management s judgments regarding the qualitative factors applied in the ALL calculation involved a high degree of subjectivity. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 We gained an understanding of the Company s process for establishing the ALL, including the qualitative adjustments made to the ALL. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s ALL process, which included, among others, management s review and approval controls designed to assess the need and level of qualitative adjustments to the ALL, as well as the reliability of the data utilized to support management s assessment. To test the qualitative adjustments, we evaluated the appropriateness of management s methodology and assessed whether all relevant risks were reflected in the ALL. 
 Regarding the measurement of the qualitative adjustments, we evaluated the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of the data and inputs utilized in management s estimate. For example, we compared the inputs and data to the Company s historical loan performance data, third-party macroeconomic data, and other internal and external data points and considered the existence of new or contrary information. Furthermore, we analyzed the changes in the components of the qualitative reserves relative to changes in external economic factors, the Company s loan portfolio, and asset quality trends, which included the evaluation of management s ability to capture and assess relevant data from both external sources and internal reports on loan customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the supporting documentation for substantiating revisions to qualitative factors. We assessed the reasonableness of the factors from both a directional perspective and from an overall magnitude perspective as compared to the underlying data. 
 We also utilized internal credit review specialists with knowledge to evaluate the appropriateness of management s risk-rating processes, to ensure that the risk ratings applied to the commercial loan portfolio were reasonable. 
 
 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2005.

industry segment, the commercial banking industry. 
 The Bank, an Ohio-chartered bank organized in 1879, provides financial services through its Banking Centers located in Holmes, Stark, Tuscarawas and Wayne counties. These communities are the source of a substantial majority of the Bank s deposit, loan, and trust activities. The majority of the Bank s income is derived from commercial and retail lending activities, and investments in securities. Its primary deposit products are checking, savings, and term certificate accounts. Its primary lending products are residential real estate, commercial real estate, commercial, and installment loans. Substantially, all loans are secured by specific items of collateral including business assets, consumer assets, and real estate. Commercial loans are expected to be repaid with cash flow from business operations. Real estate loans are secured by both residential and commercial real estate. 
 Significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented below: . required federal reserves included in Cash and due from banks at December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020. The required reserves are used to facilitate the implementation of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve System. The required reserves are computed by applying prescribed ratios to the classes of average deposit balances. These are held in the form of vault cash and depository amount held with the Federal Reserve Bank. Federal law prohibits the Company from borrowing from the Bank unless the loans are secured by specific collateral. million par value US Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities were transferred from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at their fair value on the date of transfer or at amortized cost if security purchases are designated as held-to-maturity. On December 31, 2021, of the total investment portfolio was classified as held-to-maturity. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for the accretion of discounts to maturity and the amortization of premiums to the earlier of a bond s call date or maturity based on the interest method. Such amortization and accretion is included in interest and dividends on securities. 
 Gains and losses on sales of securities are accounted for on a trade date basis, using the specific identification method, and are included in noninterest income. Securities are periodically reviewed for other-than-temporary impairment based upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than cost, the financial condition of the underlying issuer, the receipt of principal and interest according to the contractual terms, the ability of the issuer to meet contractual obligations, the likelihood of the security s ability to recover any decline in its market value and management s intent, and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in market value. Among the factors considered in determining management s intent and ability to hold the security, is a review of the Company s capital adequacy, interest rate risk position, and liquidity. The assessment of a security s ability to recover any decline in market value, the ability of the issuer to meet contractual obligations, and management s intent and ability to hold the security requires considerable judgment. A decline in value considered to be other-than-temporary, is recorded as a loss within noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

There were securities in an unrealized loss position on December 31, 2021, eleven ) of which were in a continuous loss position for twelve (12) or more months. At least quarterly, the Company conducts a comprehensive security-level impairment assessment. The assessments are based on the nature of the securities, the extent and duration of the securities, the extent and duration of the loss, and management s intent to sell or if it is more likely than not that management will be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity. Management believes the Company will fully recover the cost of these securities and it does not intend to sell these securities and likely will not be required to sell them before the anticipated recovery of the remaining amortized cost basis, which may be maturity. As a result, management concluded that these securities were not other-than-temporarily impaired on December 31, 2021.

Loan Origination/Risk Management 
 The Company has certain lending policies and procedures in place designed to maximize loan income within an acceptable level of risk. Management reviews and the Board of Directors approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis. A reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies, and non-performing and potential problem loans. Diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions. 
 Commercial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand their business. Underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking. The Company s management examines current and occasionally projected cash flows to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their obligations as agreed. Commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. However, the cash flows of borrowers may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets, such as accounts receivable or inventory, and generally incorporate a personal guarantee however, some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. 
 Commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial loans, in addition to those of real estate loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing the Company s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type. This diversity helps reduce the Company s exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single industry. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography, and risk grade criteria. 
 With respect to loans to developers and builders secured by non-owner occupied properties, the Company generally requires the borrower to have had an existing relationship with the Company and have a proven record of success. Construction and land development loans are underwritten utilizing independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analysis of absorption, lease rates, and financial analysis of developers and property owners. Construction and land development loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the completed project. These estimates may be inaccurate. Construction and land development loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent loans from approved long-term lenders, sales of developed property, or permanent financing from the Company. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risk than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, general economic conditions, and the availability of long-term financing. 
 The Company originates consumer loans utilizing a judgmental underwriting process. Policies and procedures are developed and modified, as needed, by management to monitor and manage consumer loan risk. This activity, coupled with relatively small loan amounts spread across many individual borrowers, minimizes risk. 
 The Company engages an independent loan review vendor that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis. Results of these reviews are presented to management and the Audit Committee. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as well as the Company s policies and procedures. 
 
 Paycheck Protection Program 
 The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and provided over 2 trillion in economic relief to individuals and businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act authorized the Small Business Administration SBA to temporarily guarantee loans under a new 7(a) loan program called the Paycheck Protection Program PPP ). As a qualified SBA lender, the Company was automatically authorized to originate PPP loans. The PPP provides loans to small businesses who have been affected by economic conditions as a result of COVID-19 to provide cash flow assistance to employers who maintain their payroll (including 
 19 

PPP loans with principal balances of million. The PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA and are eligible for forgiveness by the SBA to the extent that the proceeds are used to cover eligible payroll costs, interest costs, rent, and utility costs over a period of up to 24 weeks after the loan is made if certain conditions are met regarding employee retention and compensation levels. PPP loans deemed eligible for forgiveness by the SBA will be repaid by the SBA to the Company. As of December 31, 202 1 , the Company has received million in loan forgiveness from the SBA. The remaining million of PPP loans are included in the Commercial loan category with no allowance for loan losses allocated. 
 In accordance with the SBA terms and conditions on these PPP loans, the Company received approximately million in fees associated with the processing of these loans. Upon funding of the loans, these fees were deferred and are being amortized over the life of the loan as an adjustment to yield in accordance with FASB ASC 310-20-25-2. During 2021 and 2020, million and million of these fees were recognized in income, respectively with thousand remaining to be recognized. 
 Concentrations of Credit 
 Nearly all the Company s lending activity occurs within the State of Ohio, including the four counties of Holmes, Stark, Tuscarawas, and Wayne, as well as other markets. The majority of the Company s loan portfolio consists of commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans. Credit concentrations, including commitments, as determined using North American Industry Classification Codes (NAICS), to the largest industries compared to total loans at December 31, 2021, included million, or , of total loans to lessors of non-residential buildings or dwellings million, or , of total loans to assisted living facilities for the elderly million, or , of total loans to lessors of other real estate property and million, or , of total loans to lessors of residential buildings and dwellings. These loans are generally secured by real property and equipment, with repayment expected from operational cash flow. Credit evaluation is based on a review of cash flow coverage of principal, interest payments, and the adequacy of the collateral received. 
 Allowance for Loan Losses 
 The following table details activity in the allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. Allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories. 
 During 2021, the increase in the provision for loan losses for construction and land development loans was primarily related to loans to assisted living facilities that have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in the provision related to commercial, commercial real estate and residential real estate loans was primarily related to the improvement in economic conditions along with fewer delinquent and nonperforming loans and improvement in adversely classified loans. The provision related to consumer loans increased primarily as a result of the increase in historical losses of loans in this category. 
 During 2020, the increase in the provision for loan losses for commercial real estate loans was primarily related to businesses affected by the COVID economic shutdown. The provision for losses in the construction and land development category also increased due to effects of the COVID shutdown as well as the increase in volume of loans. The provision related to commercial loans decreased primarily as a result of the decrease in loans graded special mention along with the decrease in historical losses of loans in this category. 
 During 2019, the increase in the provision for loan losses related to commercial loans was primarily related to loans in the sawmill industry affected by tariffs on trade with China along with an increase in loans in the special mention category. The increase in the provision for commercial real estate loans was primarily related to the million increase in loan volume. The increase in the provision related to consumer loans was due to historical losses of loans in this category. The decrease in the provision related to residential real estate loans was primarily related to the decrease in specific allocation amounts related to three mortgage loans.

 Credit Quality Indicators 
 The Company categorizes commercial and commercial real estate loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes commercial and commercial real estate loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes commercial loans with an outstanding balance greater than thousand. This analysis is performed on an annual basis. 
 The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 
 Pass. Loans classified as pass (Cash Secured, Exceptional, Acceptable, Monitor or Pass Watch) may exhibit a wide array of characteristics but at a minimum represent an acceptable risk to the Bank. Borrowers in this rating may have leveraged but acceptable balance sheet positions, satisfactory asset quality, stable to favorable sales and earnings trends, acceptable liquidity, and adequate cash flow. Loans are considered fully collectible and require an average amount of administration. While generally adhering to credit policy, these loans may exhibit occasional exceptions that do not result in undue risk to the Bank. Borrowers are generally capable of absorbing setbacks, financial and otherwise, without the threat of failure. 
 Special Mention. Loans classified as special mention have a material weakness deserving of management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the Bank s credit position at some future date. 
 Substandard. Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses jeopardizing the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.

Letters of credit 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Consumer commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and commercial commitments are generally due on demand and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral, obtained if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include residential real estate, accounts receivable, recognized inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties. 
 Letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party and are reviewed for renewal at expiration. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. The Company requires collateral supporting these commitments when deemed appropriate. 
 The Company had a reserve for unfunded loan commitments of thousand as of December 31, 2021 and thousand as of December 31, 2020.
