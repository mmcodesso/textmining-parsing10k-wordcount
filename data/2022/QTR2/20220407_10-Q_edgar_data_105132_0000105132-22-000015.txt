Highlights The following summarizes the financial and operational highlights for our business during the six months ended February 28, 2022: Consolidated net sales increased 28.3 million, or 12 , for the six months ended February 28, 2022 compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of 2.5 million on consolidated net sales for the six months ended February 28, 2022 compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Thus, on a constant currency basis, net sales would have increased by 25.8 million, or 11 , from period to period. This favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates mainly came from our EMEA segment, which accounted for 42 of our consolidated sales for the six months ended February 28, 2022. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 50.6 for the six months ended February 28, 2022 compared to 55.9 for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased global supply chain challenges, including the increased cost of raw materials and constraints related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These ongoing challenges have resulted in increased inflation rates globally. See the Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business section which follows for details. Consolidated net income decreased 2.8 million, or 7 , for the six months ended February 28, 2022 compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of 0.5 million on consolidated net income for the six months ended February 28, 2022 compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Thus, on a constant currency basis, net income would have decreased 3.3 million, or 8 , from period to period. Diluted earnings per common share for the six months ended February 28, 2022 were 2.75 versus 2.96 in the prior fiscal year period. Our strategic initiatives and the areas where we will continue to focus our time, talent and resources in future periods include: (i) building a business for the future; (ii) attracting, developing and engaging outstanding tribe members; (iii) striving for operational excellence; (iv) growing WD-40 Multi-Use Product; (v) growing WD-40 Specialist product line; and (vi) expanding and supporting portfolio opportunities that help us grow . Significant Developments Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business Our financial results and operations continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that began during our fiscal year 2020. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global economies, the rate of inflation, supply chains, distribution networks and consumer behavior around the world. We have experienced both favorable and unfavorable impacts to our financial results and our operations as a result of the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, although sales have been negatively impacted at varying times in the regions in which we operate due to health and safety restrictions required by local governmental authorities, those negative sales impacts have generally been more than offset by increased demand for our products as a result of the shift in consumer spending patterns compared to periods before the pandemic. This shift in spending patterns, which has included increased renovation and maintenance activities as well as increased online purchases, contributed to record sales for the Company in fiscal year 2021. However, global supply chain issues have resulted in increased raw material costs and other input costs, as well as significantly higher competition for freight resources and labor constraints within distribution networks, which has also caused increased costs. These increased costs started to negatively impact our gross margin and financial results in our fiscal year 2021. We began to experience more significant negative impacts from this inflationary environment in the first half of fiscal year 2022 resulting in a lower gross margin as compared to the first half of the prior fiscal year. Some of the increasing supply chain challenges that we have experienced include general aerosol production capacity constraints and competition for such capacity by other companies who utilize the same third-party manufacturers for their aerosol production. Supply chains at many companies globally are being strained due to shortages of certain materials and this is impacting the ability of our third-party manufacturers to procure certain raw materials needed to manufacture our 

 22 

products. These challenges have periodically resulted in us not being able to meet the high level of demand for our products by customers and end-users in certain markets, most significantly those markets in our Americas segment where demand for aerosols has significantly outpaced the available production capacity in the region. We are continuing to actively manage supply chain and transportation disruptions and constraints that have arisen periodically within all three of our business segments, but particularly in the Americas, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have been actively working on various initiatives with our existing third-party manufacturers and we are also identifying and onboarding new third-party manufacturers. As a result of these initiatives, we are beginning to see increases in the capacity and flexibility of our supply chain and we were more able to meet strong end-user demand during the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. When we onboard new third-party manufacturers, it comes with inherent risks and in the current economic environment, it also potentially comes with higher costs. Although we are not able to estimate the degree of the impact or the costs associated with potential future disruptions within our supply chain and distribution networks, or the costs associated with our initiatives to address these challenges , we believe that the changes we continue to implement as a result of the pandemic will have a positive lasting impact on our ability to better manage any future disruptions. However, some of the additional costs resulting from these recent supply chain constraints , as well as the inflationary environment that is impacting our raw material costs, are expected to unfavorably impact our cost of goods sold for as long as such conditions exist. To offset these unfavorable impacts to gross margin, price increases are being implemented across all of our markets and geographies. It will take time before the full impact of these price increases is reflected in our reported results and it is possible that sales volumes may be impacted unfavorably in the short term as customers and end users adjust to increased sales prices. Although several vaccines and treatments are authorized for use against COVID-19, these vaccines and treatments are being produced, distributed and accepted at varying rates globally and circumstances continue to evolve with COVID-19 case counts and new variants. The severity and duration of this rapidly evolving pandemic remain uncertain and it is difficult for us to estimate the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our financial results and operations in future periods. It is also uncertain how more stable conditions surrounding the pandemic or the end of the pandemic will impact the high levels of renovation and maintenance activities that we have seen by end-users in recent periods. If such activities decrease in future periods, this could adversely impact our financial results. We have continued to follow a variety of measures to promote the safety and security of our employees, support the communities in which we operate and ensure the availability and functioning of our critical infrastructure. During the pandemic, these measures have included allowing for or requiring remote working arrangements for employees in some regions and the imposition of various travel restrictions. In addition, we continue to develop and monitor plans to support a safe working environment for our employees that includes reentry plans for various office locations in which we operate around the world. These plans vary by region based on the evolving situations within those regions. In connection with these plans, we have put in place our Work from Where philosophy to support work-life integration, and enable management and employees to align on where work is completed. See our risk factors disclosed in Part I Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 , which was filed with the SEC on October 22, 2021 for information on risks associated with pandemics in general and COVID-19 specifically. The Impact of Russian Military Action in Ukraine On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched significant military action against Ukraine, which has resulted in conflict and disruption in the region. In response to this action taken by Russia, the U.S. and other countries immediately imposed various economic sanctions against Russia. In the event these geopolitical tensions fail to improve or deteriorate further, additional governmental sanctions may be enacted. The direct and indirect impacts of this evolving situation and its effect on global economies in future periods are difficult to predict. We have suspended selling our products to markets in Russia and Belarus beginning in March 2022, which will have an unfavorable impact on our sales in future periods. In addition, we are currently unable to sell our products in Ukraine due to the disruption in the country. Our net sales to the regions that are directly impacted were approximately 3 of consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2021 and approximately 4 of consolidated net sales for the first half of fiscal year 2022. We do not have significant operations in these affected regions other than the distribution and sale of our products, which occurs through marketing distributors. As a result of this conflict, commodity markets remain subject to heightened levels of uncertainty, especially as they relate to the price of crude oil, which increased significantly in the immediate aftermath of the sanctions against Russia. Increases in crude oil prices unfavorably impact the cost of our products and the transportation of our products. The length and severity 

 23 

of the recent increases in the price of crude oil are highly unpredictable and may unfavorably impact our cost of goods sold for as long as these conditions exist. There is often a delay of one quarter or more before changes in raw material costs impact the cost of products sold due to production and inventory life cycles.

 (1) Current fiscal year constant currency CC net sales translated at the foreign currency exchange rates in effect for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, compared to prior period actual net sales. Americas Sales Three Months Ended February 28, 2022 Compared to February 28, 2021 Net sales of maintenance products in the Americas segment increased due to the following: United States U.S. sales increased 7.6 million, or 26 , primarily due to increased sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product and WD-40 Specialist. While the U.S. has continued to experience a high level of demand for its maintenance products after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has also continued to experience significant supply chain constraints as a result of the pandemic in both periods. However, adjustments we have made in our supply chain to increase the production capacity of our most significant products improved the availability of these products from period to period. WD-40 Multi-Use Product sales increased by 4.7 million, or 19 , primarily due to increased product availability and price increases that went into effect in the first quarter of this fiscal year. In addition, sales during the comparable period in the prior year were negatively impacted by severe winter storms that temporarily halted product delivery in the U.S., with no comparable event during the current fiscal year. WD-40 Specialist products are sourced at certain third-party manufacturers that were more significantly impacted by the various global supply chain constraints experienced over the last several quarters. WD-40 Specialist sales increased by 3.1 million, or 125 , primarily due to the improvements in these supply chain conditions which significantly improved product availability in the second quarter of this year, as well as price increases. Latin America sales increased 1.5 million, or 18 , primarily due to successful promotional programs and increased product availability in certain of our Latin America markets, as well as favorable impacts from sales price increases that went into effect in November 2021 in our distributor markets. In addition, the continued momentum from the shift in the Mexico market from a distributor model to the direct model that we made in late fiscal year 2020 favorably impacted sales period over period as a result of new distribution and continued growth of the base business. In addition, sales in Mexico increased due to customers purchasing product in advance of a price increase that went into effect in February 2022. Canada sales remained relatively consistent period over period. Net sales of HCCP brands in the Americas decreased primarily due to the following: Challenges in our Americas supply chain, primarily in the U.S., resulted in decreased product availability and lower net sales for most HCCP brands. While we have been actively working to increase the capacity and flexibility of our supply chain in recent periods, the adjustments we have made to date have been more heavily focused on our most significant products, primarily our maintenance products. While each of our homecare and cleaning products have continued to generate positive cash flows, we have experienced flat or slightly decreased sales for many of these products in recent periods. 

 25 

For the three months ended February 28, 2022, 74 of sales came from the U.S., and 26 of sales came from Canada and Latin America combined compared to the distribution for the three months ended February 28, 2021 when 72 of sales came from the U.S., and 28 of sales came from Canada and Latin America. Americas Sales Six Months Ended February 28, 2022 Compared to February 28, 2021 Net sales of maintenance products in the Americas segment increased due primarily to the following: U.S. sales increased 7.1 million, or 11 , due to increased sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product and WD-40 Specialist of 6.2 million, or 11 , and 1.8 million, or 25 , respectively. These increases for both products were primarily due to price increases that went into effect in the first quarter of this fiscal year and supply chain improvements which resulted in increased product availability as discussed above in the section for the three months ended February 28, 2022 . These increases were slightly offset by lower 3-IN-ONE sales of 0.9 million, or 23 , due to decreased product availability as a result of the supply chain constraints we have experienced at our third-party manufacturers who produce this product. Latin America sales increased 5.5 million, or 31 , primarily due to higher sales throughout many markets in the region, including in our direct market in Mexico. Increased sales were primarily due to many distributor customers and Mexico direct customers purchasing product in advance of price increases that went into effect in the first half of this fiscal year. In addition, sales were favorably impacted by increased product availability, successful promotional programs, price increases and the continued momentum in our direct market in Mexico, as discussed above in the section for the three months ended February 28, 2022. Canada sales remained relatively consistent period over period. Net sales of HCCP in the Americas decreased due to the following: Challenges in our Americas supply chain negatively impacted net sales for these products, as discussed above in the section for the three months ended February 28, 2022. For the six months ended February 28, 2022, 72 of sales came from the U.S., and 28 of sales came from Canada and Latin America combined, compared to the distribution for the six months ended February 28, 2021 when 75 of sales came from the U.S., and 25 of sales came from Canada and Latin America. EMEA Sales The following table summarizes net sales by product line for the EMEA segment, which includes Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India (in thousands, except percentages): Three Months Ended February 28, Six Months Ended February 28, Change from Prior Year Change from Prior Year 2022 2021 Dollars Percent 2022 2021 Dollars Percent Maintenance products 52,093 47,736 4,357 9 107,536 100,114 7,422 7 HCCP 1,970 2,077 (107) (5) 4,082 4,449 (367) (8) Total (1) 54,063 49,813 4,250 9 111,618 104,563 7,055 7 of consolidated net sales 42 45 42 44 CC Net sales - non-GAAP (2) 54,617 49,813 4,804 10 109,695 104,563 5,132 5 
 (1) While the Company s reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar, the functional currency of our U.K. subsidiary, the entity in which the EMEA results are generated, is Pound Sterling. Although the functional currency of this subsidiary is Pound Sterling, approximately 50 of its sales are generated in Euro and 15-20 are generated in U.S. Dollar. As a result, the Pound Sterling sales and earnings for the EMEA segment can be negatively or positively impacted from period to period upon translation from these currencies depending on whether the Euro and U.S. Dollar are weakening or strengthening against the Pound Sterling .

The countries and regions in Europe where we sell through a direct sales force include the U.K., Italy, France, Iberia (which includes Spain and Portugal) and the Germanics sales region (which includes Austria, Denmark, Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands). The regions in the EMEA segment where we sell through local distributors include the Middle East, Africa, India, Eastern and Northern Europe. EMEA Sales Three Months Ended February 28, 2022 Compared to February 28, 2021 Net sales increased in the EMEA segment primarily due to the following: Direct Markets EMEA (65 of net sales QTD FY2022 vs 67 QTD FY2021) Direct market sales increased 2.1 million, or 6 , primarily due to increased sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product in all direct markets, with the exception of the U.K.. Sales in the EMEA direct markets, excluding the U.K., increased 3.1 million, or 12 . These increases were primarily due to the favorable impacts of price increases that were implemented over the last twelve months, as well as many customers purchasing product in advance of additional price increases that will occur during the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. These increases were partially offset by lower sales in the U.K., which were down 1.0 million, or 12 , primarily due to a lower level of promotional programs that were conducted period over period, which was slightly offset by the favorable impacts of sales price increases. Sales in our direct markets were unfavorably impacted by the weakening of the Pound Sterling, the functional currency of our U.K. subsidiary, against the U.S. Dollar. In addition, sales in our direct markets were unfavorably impacted by the weakening of the Euro against the Pound Sterling from period to period for sales generated in our Euro-based direct markets. Distributor Markets EMEA (35 of net sales QTD FY2022 vs 33 QTD FY2021) Distributor market sales increased 2.2 million, or 13 , primarily due to increased sales of maintenance products in Russia, which were up 0.7 million, as well as higher sales in Turkey, Poland, and the Czech Republic, each of which was up 0.5 million. See The Impact of Russian Military Action in Ukraine described in the Significant Developments section above for further information regarding the suspension of our sales to Russian markets. These increases were primarily due to the timing of customer orders from period to period, price increases and distributors purchasing product in advance of additional price increases that will occur during the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. EMEA Sales Six Months Ended February 28, 2022 Compared to February 28, 2021 Net sales increased in the EMEA segment due to the following drivers: Direct Markets EMEA (64 of net sales YTD FY2022 vs 66 YTD FY2021) Direct markets increased 3.1 million, or 5 , primarily due to increased sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product and WD-40 Specialist in all direct markets, with the exception of the U.K. Sales in the EMEA direct markets, excluding the U.K. increased 5.6 million, or 11 , primarily due to new distribution and successful promotional programs during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as well as the favorable impacts of price increases, as discussed above in the section for the three months ended February 28, 2022. These increases were partially offset by lower sales in the U.K., which were down 2.5 million, or 14 , primarily due to a lower level of promotional programs that were conducted period over period and the timing of customer orders, which were slightly offset by sales price increases. Sales in our direct markets benefited from the strengthening of the Pound Sterling, the functional currency of our U.K. subsidiary, against the U.S. Dollar. However, these benefits were more than offset in the opposite direction as a result of the weakening of the Euro against the Pound Sterling from period to period for sales generated in our Euro-based direct markets. 

 27 

Distributor Markets EMEA (36 of net sales YTD FY2022 vs 34 YTD FY2021) Distributor markets increased 4.0 million, or 11 , primarily due to increased sales of the WD-40 Multi-Use Product in Poland, Russia and the Czech Republic, which were up 1.5 million, 1.3 million and 1.0 million, respectively. Increased sales in the distributor markets were primarily due to new distribution, successful promotional programs and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as well as other impacts discussed above in the section for the three months ended February 28, 2022 . Asia-Pacific Sales The following table summarizes net sales by product line for the Asia-Pacific segment, which includes Australia, China and other countries in the Asia region (in thousands, except percentages): Three Months Ended February 28, Six Months Ended February 28, Change from Prior Year Change from Prior Year 2022 2021 Dollars Percent 2022 2021 Dollars Percent Maintenance products 19,399 13,682 5,717 42 38,002 27,146 10,856 40 HCCP 2,027 2,253 (226) (10) 4,327 4,411 (84) (2) Total 21,426 15,935 5,491 34 42,329 31,557 10,772 34 of consolidated net sales 16 14 16 13 CC Net sales - non-GAAP (1) 21,579 15,935 5,644 35 42,035 31,557 10,478 33

Asia-Pacific Sales Three Months Ended February 28, 2022 Compared to February 28, 2021 Net sales in the Asia-Pacific segment increased primarily due to the following: Asia distributor markets sales increased 3.8 million, or 64 , primarily due to higher sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product as a result of distributors purchasing product in advance of a price increase that went into effect in March 2022, as well as the timing of customer orders and promotional programs from period to period. In addition, sales increased due to the continued easing of COVID-19 lockdown measures and restrictions compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. These reduced lockdown measures positively impacted economic conditions during the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 and resulted in increased demand and higher sales in most countries. China sales increased 2.0 million, or 42 , primarily due to a higher level of promotional activities as well as customers purchasing product in advance of a price increase that went into effect during the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. Australia sales decreased 0.3 million, or 5 , primarily due to decreased sales of homecare and cleaning products, which were down 0.2 million, or 10 . Asia-Pacific Sales Six Months Ended February 28, 2022 Compared to February 28, 2021 Net sales in the Asia-Pacific segment increased due to the following drivers: Sales in the Asia distributor markets increased 6.3 million, or 49 , primarily due to the various impacts discussed above in the section for the three months ended February 28, 2022. Sales in China increased 4.4 million, or 54 , primarily due to a higher level of promotional activities as well as price increases that went into effect during the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. In addition, sales increased due to the timing of customer orders from period to period. Australia sales remained relatively consistent period over period .

Gross Profit The following general information regarding the timing and nature of our product costs is important when assessing fluctuations in our gross margin from period to period: There is often a delay of one quarter or more before changes in raw materials, such as specialty chemicals used in the formulation of our products, impact cost of products sold due to production and inventory life cycles; In general, the timing of advertising, promotional and other discounts may cause fluctuations in gross margin from period to period. Advertising, promotional and other discounts that are given to our customers are recorded as a reduction to sales, whereas advertising and sales promotional costs associated with promotional activities that we pay to third parties are recorded as advertising and sales promotion expenses; In the EMEA segment, the majority of our cost of goods sold is denominated in Pound Sterling whereas sales are generated in Pound Sterling, Euro and the U.S. Dollar. The strengthening or weakening of the Euro and U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling may result in foreign currency related changes to the gross margin percentage in the EMEA segment from period to period; and O ur gross profit and gross margin may not be comparable to those of other consumer product companies, since some of these companies include all costs related to distribution of their products in cost of products sold, whereas we exclude the portion associated with amounts paid to third parties for shipment to our customers from our distribution centers and contract manufacturers and include these costs in selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs totaled 4.7 million and 3.5 million for the three months ended February 28, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and 9.5 million and 7.7 million for the six months ended February 28, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For further information pertaining to recent trends and economic conditions affecting gross margin, please see the section titled Significant Developments .

 SG A Expenses Three Months Ended February 28, 2022 Compared to February 28, 2021 The decrease in SG A expenses was primarily due to lower employee-related costs, which decreased by 1.9 million due to lower incentive compensation accruals of 3.2 million, which were partially offset by increased headcount and annual compensation increases. The lower incentive compensation accruals are based on our most current forecast for fiscal year 2022 and we are projecting a lower level of achievement than the prior year for such compensation. In addition, lower miscellaneous costs also decreased SG A expenses by 0.5 million from period to period. These decreases were significantly offset by freight cost increases of 1.2 million due to higher sales levels as well as carrier price increases associated with supply chain constraints and limited capacity in the global distribution networks. In addition, travel and meeting expense increased 0.5 million due to the reduction in travel restrictions related to COVID-19. SG A Expenses Six Months Ended February 28, 2022 Compared to February 28, 2021 The increase in SG A expenses from period to period was due to a variety of factors. Freight costs increased 1.8 million due to higher sales levels as well as carrier price increases associated with supply chain constraints and limited capacity in the global distribution networks. Additionally, travel and meeting expense increased 1.1 million due to the reduction in travel restrictions related to COVID-19. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates from period to period also resulted in an increase of 0.5 million in SG A expenses. These increases to SG A expenses were offset by lower employee-related costs of 1.6 million, primarily due to lower incentive compensation accruals of 4.0 million, which were partially offset by increased headcount and annual compensation increases. Note that we continued our research and development investment, the majority of which is associated with our maintenance products, in support of our focus on innovation and renovation of our products. Research and development costs were 1.3 million for both the three months ended February 28, 2022 and 2021, and 2.6 million and 2.9 million for the six months ended February 28, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our research and development team engages in consumer research, product development, current product improvements and testing activities. This team leverages its development capabilities by collaborating with a network of outside resources including our current and prospective third-party contract manufacturers. The level and types of expenses incurred within research and development can vary from period to period depending upon the types of activities being performed.

 A P Expenses Three Months Ended February 28, 2022 Compared to February 28, 2021 Although, A P expenses increased slightly from period to period, A P expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to a lower level of promotional programs and marketing support in the Americas segment. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on A P expenses period over period. As a percentage of net sales, A P expenses may fluctuate period to period based upon the type of marketing activities we employ and the period in which the costs are incurred. Total promotional costs recorded as a reduction to sales was 6.4 million and 5.9 million for three months ended February 28, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Therefore, our total investment in A P activities totaled 12.0 million and 11.4 million for the three months ended February 28, 2022 and 2021, respectively. A P Expenses Six Months Ended February 28, 2022 Compared to February 28, 2021 Although A P expenses increased slightly from period to period, A P expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to a lower level of promotional programs and marketing support in the Americas segment.

 Americas Americas Operating Income Three Months Ended February 28, 2022 Compared to February 28, 2021 Income from operations for the Americas increased to 11.2 million, up 0.9 million, or 8 , primarily due to an 8.3 million increase in sales, partially offset by a lower gross margin. Gross margin for the Americas segment decreased from 53.5 to 46.7 primarily due to increases in the costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals. In addition, gross margin was 

 31 

unfavorably impacted by increased warehousing, distribution and freight costs and higher costs at our third-party manufacturers due to supply chain constraints and inflationary impacts as a result of the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic . These unfavorable impacts to gross margin were partially offset by the favorable impacts of price increases that were implemented during the first half of fiscal year 2022. Although operating expenses remained relatively constant from period to period, there were various items that offset each other from period to period. Operating expenses associated with higher outbound freight costs as a result of increased sales and higher freight rates, increased headcount and salaries, and higher travel and meeting expenses were completely offset by lower accrued incentive compensation and lower A P expenses from period to period. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased from 22.4 to 20.6 period over period . Americas Operating Income Six Months Ended February 28, 2022 Compared to February 28, 2021 Income from operations for the Americas decreased to 23.2 million, down 1.7 million, or 7 , primarily due to a lower gross margin and higher operating expenses, partially offset by a 10.4 million increase in sales. Gross margin for the Americas segment decreased from 53.9 to 47.7 primarily due to increases in the costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals. In addition, gross margin was unfavorably impacted by increased warehousing, distribution and freight costs and higher costs at our third-party manufacturers due to supply chain constraints and inflationary impacts as a result of the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as increases in the discounts provided to customers . These unfavorable impacts to gross margin were partially offset by the combined favorable impacts of price increases that were implemented during the first half of fiscal year 2022 as well as increased supplier rebates primarily as a result of higher aerosol can purchase volumes from period to period . Operating expenses increased period over period primarily due to higher outbound freight costs as a result of increased sales and higher freight rates, increased headcount and salaries, and higher travel and meeting expenses, which were partially offset by lower accrued incentive compensation and lower A P expenses. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased from 24.9 to 21.0 period over period . EMEA EMEA Operating Income Three Months Ended February 28, 2022 Compared to February 28, 2021 Income from operations for the EMEA segment decreased to 13.7 million, down 0.5 million, or 3 , primarily due to a lower gross margin and an increase in operating expenses, partially offset by a 4.2 million increase in sales. Gross margin for the EMEA segment decreased from 56.7 to 52.0 period over period primarily due to increased costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans as well as unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These unfavorable impacts to gross margin were partially offset by price increases that were implemented over the last twelve months . Operating expenses increased 0.3 million period over period primarily due to higher A P expenses, increased headcount and salaries, and higher travel and meeting expenses, which were significantly offset by lower accrued incentive compensation during the period. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased from 28.5 to 25.4 period over period . EMEA Operating Income Six Months Ended February 28, 2022 Compared to February 28, 2021 Income from operations for the EMEA segment decreased to 27.9 million, down 4.0 million, or 13 , primarily due to a lower gross margin and an increase in operating expenses, partially offset by a 7.1 million increase in sales. Gross margin for the EMEA segment decreased from 57.6 to 51.8 period over period primarily due to increased costs of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans as well as unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, gross margin was also unfavorably impacted by increased warehousing, distribution and freight costs from period to period due to supply chain constraints and inflationary impacts as a result of the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These unfavorable impacts to gross margin were partially offset by price increases that were implemented over the last twelve months, as well as decreases to advertising, promotional, and other discounts given to our customers from period to period. Operating expenses increased 1.5 million period over period primarily due to higher A P expenses, increased headcount and salaries, and higher travel and meeting expenses, which were partially offset by lower accrued incentive compensation. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased from 30.5 to 25.0 period over period .

Asia-Pacific Asia-Pacific Operating Income Three Months Ended February 28, 2022 Compared to February 28, 2021 Income from operations for the Asia-Pacific segment increased to 7.9 million, up 2.7 million, or 53 , primarily due to a 5.5 million increase in sales, partially offset by a lower gross margin. Gross margin for the Asia-Pacific segment decreased from 56.9 to 55.9 period over period primarily due to increases to the cost of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans from period to period . These unfavorable impacts to gross margin were partially offset by price increases that were implemented during the first half of fiscal year 2022, as well as decreases in advertising, promotional, and other discounts given to our customers from period to period. Operating expenses remained relatively constant from period to period. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased from 32.6 to 37.0 period over period. Asia-Pacific Operating Income Six Months Ended February 28, 2022 Compared to February 28, 2021 Income from operations for the Asia-Pacific segment increased to 15.2 million, up 5.0 million, or 49 , primarily due to a 10.8 million increase in sales, partially offset by a lower gross margin and increased operating expenses. Gross margin for the Asia-Pacific segment decreased from 56.8 to 55.2 period over period primarily due to increases to the cost of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans from period to period . These unfavorable impacts to gross margin were partially offset by price increases that were implemented during the first half of fiscal year 2022, as well as decreases to advertising, promotional, and other discounts given to our customers from period to period. Operating expenses increased 0.5 million from period to period primarily due to higher A P expenses and increased headcount and salaries, which were partially offset by lower accrued incentive compensation . Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased from 32.5 to 36.0 period over period . Non-Operating Items The following table summarizes non-operating income and expenses for our consolidated operations (in thousands): Three Months Ended February 28, Six Months Ended February 28, 2022 2021 Change 2022 2021 Change Interest income 21 19 2 46 38 8 Interest expense 613 610 3 1,233 1,180 53 Other income (expense), net 252 151 101 (77) 330 (407) Provision for income taxes 4,895 3,024 1,871 9,476 7,421 2,055 
 Interest Income Interest income was not significant during the three and six months ended February 28, 2022 and 2021. Interest Expense Interest expense was relatively constant during the three and six months ended February 28, 2022 and 2021 . Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was not significant during the three and six months ended February 28, 2022 and 2021 . Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was 20.1 and 15.0 of income before income taxes for the three months ended February 28, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in the effective income tax rate from period to period was primarily due to a non-recurring benefit received in the prior year from the settlement of stock-based equity awards. 

 33 

The provision for income taxes was 19.9 and 15.4 of income before income taxes for the six months ended February 28, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in the effective income tax rate from period to period was primarily due to non-recurring benefits received in the prior year from stock-based compensation, coupled with an increase in performance-based compensation that is not deductible for tax purposes in the current fiscal year. Net Income Net income was 19.5 million, or 1.41 per common share on a fully diluted basis, for the three months ended February 28, 2022 compared to 17.2 million, or 1.24 per common share on a fully diluted basis, for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on consolidated net income for the three months ended February 28, 2022 compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Net income was 38.1 million, or 2.75 per common share on a fully diluted basis, for the six months ended February 28, 2022 compared to 40.8 million, or 2.96 per common share on a fully diluted basis, for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of 0.5 million on consolidated net income for the six months ended February 28, 2022 compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Thus, on a constant currency basis, net income would have decreased 3.3 million, or 8 , from period to period. Performance Measures and Non-GAAP Reconciliations In managing our business operations and assessing our financial performance, we supplement the information provided by our financial statements with certain non-GAAP performance measures. These performance measures are part of our current 55/30/25 business model, which includes gross margin, cost of doing business, and earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), the latter two of which are non-GAAP performance measures. Cost of doing business is defined as total operating expenses less amortization of definite-lived intangible assets, impairment charges related to intangible assets and depreciation in operating departments, and EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We target our gross margin to be at or above 55 of net sales, our cost of doing business to be at 30 of net sales, and our EBITDA to be above 25 of net sales. Results for these performance measures may vary from period to period depending on various factors, including economic conditions and our level of investment in activities for the future such as those related to quality assurance, regulatory compliance, and intellectual property protection in order to safeguard our WD-40 brand. The targets for these performance measures are long-term in nature, particularly those for cost of doing business and EBITDA, and we expect to make progress towards achieving them over time. The following table summarizes the results of these performance measures for the periods presented: Three Months Ended February 28, Six Months Ended February 28, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Gross margin - GAAP 50 55 51 56 Cost of doing business as a percentage of net sales - non-GAAP 30 36 31 34 EBITDA as a percentage of net sales - non-GAAP (1) 21 20 20 22 
 (1) Percentages may not aggregate to EBITDA percentage due to rounding and because amounts recorded in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statement of operations are not included as an adjustment to earnings in the EBITDA calculation. We use the performance measures above to establish financial goals and to gain an understanding of our comparative performance from period to period. We believe that these measures provide our shareholders with additional insights into the Company s results of operations and how we run our business. The non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental in nature and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income, income from operations or other financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP as indicators of the Company s performance or operations. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to our financial statements as prepared in accordance with GAAP are as follows:

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our financial condition and liquidity remain strong. Although there continues to be uncertainty related to the anticipated impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic on our future results, we believe our efficient business model and the steps that we have taken position us to manage our business through this crisis as it continues to unfold. We continue to manage all aspects of our business including, but not limited to, monitoring our liquidity, the financial health of our customers, suppliers and other third-party relationships, implementing gross margin enhancement strategies and developing new opportunities for growth. Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, as well as cash generated from operations and cash currently available from our existing unsecured revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement with Bank of America. We use proceeds of the revolving credit facility primarily for our general working capital needs. We also hold borrowings under the Note Agreement. See Note 7 Debt for additional information on these agreements. We have historically held a balance of outstanding draws on our line of credit in either U.S. Dollars in the Americas segment, or in Euros and Pound Sterling in the EMEA segment. Euro and Pound Sterling denominated draws will fluctuate in U.S. Dollars from period to period due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We regularly convert many of our draws on our line of credit to new draws with new maturity dates and interest rates. We have the ability to refinance any draws under the line of credit with successive short-term borrowings through the September 30, 2025 maturity date of the Credit Agreement. Outstanding draws for which we have the ability and intent to refinance with successive short-term borrowings for a period of at least twelve months are classified as long-term. As of February 28, 2022, 44.8 million of the outstanding balance under our line of credit resides in the EMEA segment and is denominated in Euros and Pound Sterling and classified long-term, whereas 1.2 million is denominated in U.S. Dollar and classified as short-term. In the United States, we held 68.8 million in fixed rate long-term borrowings as of February 28, 2022, consisting of senior notes under our Note 

 35 

Agreement. We paid 0.4 million in principal payments on our Series A Notes during the first half of fiscal year 2022. There were no other letters of credit outstanding or restrictions on the amount available on our line of credit or notes. Per the terms of both the Note Agreement and the Credit Agreement, our consolidated leverage ratio cannot be greater than three and a half to one and our consolidated interest coverage ratio cannot be less than three to one. See Note 7 Debt for additional information on these financial covenants. At February 28, 2022, we were in compliance with all material debt covenants. We continue to monitor our compliance with all debt covenants and, at the present time, we believe that the likelihood of being unable to satisfy all material covenants is remote. At February 28, 2022, we had a total of 43.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. We do not foresee any ongoing issues with repaying our borrowings and we closely monitor the use of this credit facility. We believe that our future cash from domestic and international operations, together with our access to funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility, will provide adequate resources to fund short-term and long-term operating requirements, capital expenditures, dividend payments, acquisitions, new business development activities and share repurchases. On October 12, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan. Under the plan, which became effective on November 1, 2021, we are authorized to acquire up to 75.0 million of its outstanding shares through August 31, 2023, of which 56.8 million remains available for the repurchase of common shares at February 28, 2022. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows by category for the periods presented (in thousands): Six Months Ended February 28, 2022 2021 Change Net cash provided by operating activities 4,083 42,510 (38,427) Net cash used in investing activities (3,571) (7,366) 3,795 Net cash provided by used in financing activities (42,267) (20,311) (21,956) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (884) 1,086 (1,970) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (42,639) 15,919 (58,558) 
 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 38.4 million to 4.1 million for the six months ended February 28, 2022 from 42.5 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Cash flows from operating activities depend heavily on operating performance and changes in working capital. Our primary source of operating cash flows for the six months ended February 28, 2022 was net income of 38.1 million, which decreased approximately 2.8 million from period to period. The change in our working capital, which decreased net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to increases in inventory in the Americas segment from period to period. This increase in inventory was due to deliberate actions we took to stock certain raw materials and finished goods given the current challenges within supply chain, as well as the higher carrying value of inventory due to higher raw material costs and other input costs from period to period. Net cash provided by operating activities was further decreased due to higher earned incentive payouts in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year as well as lower level of earned incentive accruals from period to period. In addition, increases in trade accounts receivable balances, primarily in the United Kingdom, decreased net cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended February 28, 2022 compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year as a result of increased sales and the timing of payments from customers. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities decreased 3.8 million to 3.6 million for the six months ended February 28, 2022 from 7.4 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a lower level of manufacturing-related capital expenditures within the United States and the United Kingdom from period to period. Capital expenditures during fiscal years 2021 and 2022 were primarily related to manufacturing equipment, some of which is still under construction, and will be located at our third-party manufacturers in the United States and the United Kingdom once completed. 

 36 

Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities increased 22.0 million to 42.3 million for the six months ended February 28, 2022 from 20.3 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. This change was primarily due to the resumption of treasury stock purchases in November 2021, resulting in increased treasury stock purchases of 18.2 million. In addition, increases in dividends paid to our shareholders of 2.2 million and increases in shares withheld to cover taxes on conversion of equity rewards of 0.8 million resulted in higher cash outflows from period to period. Additionally, in the first half of fiscal year 2021, we repaid 50.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our line of credit using 52.0 million in proceeds that we received from the issuance and sale of senior notes during the quarter. This net borrowing activity resulted in a 2.0 million cash inflow during the first half of fiscal year 2021 compared to 1.2 million in net proceeds from our revolving credit facility during the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. Effect of Exchange Rate Changes All of our foreign subsidiaries currently operate in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar and a significant portion of our consolidated cash balance is denominated in these foreign functional currencies, particularly at our U.K. subsidiary, which operates in Pound Sterling. As a result, our cash and cash equivalents balances are subject to the effects of the fluctuations in these functional currencies against the U.S. Dollar at the end of each reporting period. The net effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents, when expressed in U.S. Dollar terms, was a decrease in cash of 0.9 million for the six months ended February 28, 2022 as compared to an increase in cash of 1.1 million for the six months ended February 28, 2021. These changes were primarily due to fluctuations in various foreign currency exchange rates from period to period, but the majority is related to the fluctuations in the Pound Sterling against the U.S. Dollar. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Commercial Commitments We have ongoing relationships with various third-party suppliers (contract manufacturers) that manufacture our products and third-party distribution centers which warehouse and ship our products to customers. The contract manufacturers maintain title and control of certain raw materials and components, materials utilized in finished products, and of the finished products themselves until shipment to our customers or third-party distribution centers in accordance with agreed upon shipment terms. Although we have definitive minimum purchase obligations in the contract terms with certain of our contract manufacturers, when such obligations have been included, they have either been immaterial or the minimum amounts have been such that they are well below the volume of goods that we have historically purchased. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we communicate supply needs to our contract manufacturers based on orders and short-term projections, ranging from two to six months. We are committed to purchase the products produced by the contract manufacturers based on the projections provided. Upon the termination of contracts with contract manufacturers, we obtain certain inventory control rights and are obligated to work with the contract manufacturer to sell through all product held by or manufactured by the contract manufacturer on our behalf during the termination notification period. If any inventory remains at the contract manufacturer at the termination date, we are obligated to purchase such inventory which may include raw materials, components and finished goods . The amounts for inventory purchased under termination commitments have been immaterial. In addition to the commitments to purchase products from contract manufacturers described above, we may also enter into commitments with other manufacturers to purchase finished goods and components to support innovation initiatives and/or supply chain initiatives. As of February 28, 2022, no such commitments were outstanding .

Dividends On March 15, 2022, the Company s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 0.78 per share payable on April 29, 2022 to shareholders of record on April 15 , 2022 . Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our operating results and financial condition is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Critical accounting policies are those that involve subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates. The following areas all require the use of judgments and estimates: revenue recognition, accounting for income taxes and impairment of definite-lived intangible assets. Estimates in each of these areas are based on historical experience and various judgments and assumptions that we believe are appropriate. Actual results may differ from these estimates. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies from those disclosed in Part II Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on October 22, 2021.

Accordingly, the board of directors of the Company (the Board has determined that it is appropriate and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders that provisions be made to encourage the Executive s continued attention and undistracted dedication to the Executive s duties in the potentially disturbing circumstances of a possible change in control of the Company, by providing the Executive with some degree of personal financial security under such circumstances. 

NOW THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

(b) if individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board (the Incumbent Board cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the Company s stockholders, was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then constituting the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of either an actual or threatened election contest subject to Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board; or 

(c) approval by the stockholders of the Company of a reorganization, merger or consolidation, unless following such reorganization, merger or consolidation (i) more than 60 of, respectively, the then-outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger or consolidation and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such reorganization, merger, or consolidation in substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such reorganization, merger or consolidation, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may be (for purposes of determining whether such percentage test is satisfied, there shall be excluded from the number of shares and voting securities of the resulting corporation owned by the Company's stockholders, but not from the total number of outstanding shares and voting securities of the resulting corporation, any shares or voting securities received by any such stockholder in respect of any consideration other than shares or voting securities of the Company); (ii) no Person (excluding the Company, any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company, any qualified employee benefit plan of such corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger or consolidation and any Person beneficially owning, immediately prior to such reorganization, merger or consolidation, directly or indirectly, 20 or more of the Outstanding Company Common Stock or Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may be) beneficially

(d) (i) approval by the stockholders of the Company of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or (ii) the first to occur of (A) the sale or other disposition (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or (B) the approval by the stockholders of the Company of any such sale or disposition, other than, in each case, any such sale or disposition to a corporation, with respect to which immediately thereafter, (1) more than 60 of, respectively, the then-outstanding shares of common stock of such corporation and the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities of such corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such sale or other disposition in substantially the same proportion as their ownership, immediately prior to such sale or other disposition, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may be (for purposes of determining whether such percentage test is satisfied, there shall be excluded from the number of shares and voting securities of the transferee corporation owned by the Company s stockholders, but not from the total number of outstanding shares and voting securities of the transferee corporation, any shares or voting securities received by any such stockholder in respect of any consideration other than shares or voting securities of the Company); (2) no Person (excluding the Company, any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company, any qualified employee benefit plan of such transferee corporation and any Person beneficially owning, immediately prior to such sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, 20 or more of the Outstanding Company Common Stock or Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may be) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 30 or more of, respectively, the then-outstanding shares of common stock of such transferee corporation and the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities of such transferee corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; and (3) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of such transferee corporation were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement or action of the board providing for such sale or other disposition of assets of the Company. 

2. Termination Following a Change in Control : 

(a) The Executive shall be entitled to the compensation provided for in Paragraph 3 if all of the following conditions are satisfied: 

(i) there is a Change in Control of the Company while the Executive is still an employee of the Company; 

(ii) the Executive s employment with the Company is terminated within two years after the Change in Control; and 

(iii) the Executive's termination of employment is not a result of (A) the Executive's death; (B) the Executive s Disability (as defined in subparagraph 2(b) below); (C) the Executive s Retirement (as defined in subparagraph 2(c) below); (D) the Executive's termination by the Company for Cause (as defined in subparagraph 2(d) below); or (E) the Executive s decision to terminate employment other than for Good Reason (as defined in subparagraph 2(e) below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change of Control occurs and if the Executive's employment with the Company is terminated prior to the date on which the Change of Control occurs, and if it is reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination of employment (i) was at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or in anticipation of a Change of Control, then the Executive shall be entitled to the compensation provided for in Paragraph 3. 

(b) If, as a result of the Executive s incapacity due to physical or mental illness, the Executive shall have been unable, with or without a reasonable accommodation, to perform the Executive s duties with the Company on a full time basis for six months and if, within 30 days after a Notice of Termination (as defined in subparagraph 2(f)) is thereafter given by the Company, the Executive shall not have returned to the full time performance of the Executive's duties, the Company may terminate the Executive's employment for Disability . 

(c) The term Retirement as used in this Agreement shall mean termination by the Company or the Executive of the Executive s employment under circumstances whereby the Executive is otherwise entitled to receive benefits payable under the presently existing Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan entered into between the Company and the Executive or such other nonqualified retirement benefit plan providing substantially similar benefits. 

(d) The Company may terminate the Executive's employment for Cause before or after a Change in Control. For purposes of this Agreement only, Cause shall mean: (i) the Executive s commission of acts subject to prosecution as a felony involving moral turpitude; (ii) the Executive s material breach of fiduciary duty as an executive officer of the Company which has resulted, or is likely to result, in material economic damage to the Company; or (iii) the Executive s willful gross misconduct or willful gross neglect of duties (other than any such neglect resulting from the Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness or any such neglect after the issuance of a Notice of Termination by the Executive for Good Reason, as such terms are defined in subparagraphs (e) and (f) below and as they may apply under this Paragraph 2); provided that no act or failure to act by the Executive will constitute Cause under clause (ii) if the Executive believed in good faith that such act or failure to act was in the best interest of the Company. 

Any termination of the Executive s employment by the Company for Cause shall be authorized by a vote of at least a majority of the independent members of the Board (as they may be determined by the Board from time to time) within 12 months of a majority of such independent members of the Board having actual knowledge of the event or circumstances providing a basis for such termination. In the case of clauses (i) and (ii) of the second sentence of this subparagraph (d), the Executive shall be given notice by the Board specifying in detail the particular act or failure to act on which the Board is relying in proposing to terminate the Executive for Cause and offering the Executive an opportunity, on a date at least 14 days after receipt of such notice, to have a hearing, with counsel, before a majority of the independent members of the Board, including each of the members of the Board who authorized the termination for Cause. The Executive shall not be terminated for Cause if, within 30 days after the date of the Executive s hearing before the Board (or if the Executive waives a hearing, within 30 days after receiving notice of the proposed termination), the Executive has corrected the particular act or failure to act specified in the notice given under clause (ii) of the second sentence of this subparagraph (d), and by so correcting such act or failure to act the Executive has reduced the economic damage the act or failure to act has allegedly caused the Company to a level which is no longer material or has eliminated the probability that such act or failure to act is likely to result in material economic damage to the Company. No termination for Cause shall take effect until the expiration of the correction period described in the preceding sentence and the determination by a majority of the independent members of the Board that the Executive has failed to correct the act or failure to act in accordance with the terms of the preceding sentence. Other than as specified herein, the decision of a majority of the independent members of the Board of Directors with respect to any determination of the grounds for termination of the Executive s employment for Cause shall be binding absent evidence of bad faith or manifest injustice. 

(e) The Executive may terminate the Executive s employment for Good Reason at any time following a Change in Control. For purposes of this Agreement, Good Reason shall mean, after any Change in Control and without the Executive s express written consent, any of the following: 

(i) a significant diminution in the Executive's duties and responsibilities, or the assignment to the Executive by the Company of duties inconsistent with the Executive's position, duties, responsibilities or status with the Company immediately prior to a Change in Control of the Company, or any removal of the Executive from or any failure to re-elect the Executive to any of such positions, except in connection with the termination of employment for Disability, Retirement or Cause or as a result of the Executive s death or by the Executive other than for Good Reason; 

(ii) a reduction by the Company in the Executive s annual rate of base salary as in effect immediately prior to a Change of Control or the Company s failure to increase (within 12 months of the Executive s last adjustment in annual rate of base salary) the Executive's annual rate of base salary after a Change in Control of the Company in an amount which at least equals, on a percentage basis, the average percentage increase in the annual rate of base salary most recently or then currently being effected for all other executive officers of the Company; 

(iii) (A) any failure by the Company to continue in effect any benefit plan or arrangement (including, without limitation, medical, dental, and other established benefit plans Welfare Benefit Plans ), group life insurance and retirement plans) in which the Executive is participating at the time of a Change in Control of the Company (all hereinafter referred to as Benefit Plans unless the Executive receives benefits through another plan or arrangement providing the Executive with benefits, when considered in the aggregate, that are no less favorable than the benefits under all Benefit Plans available to the Executive at the time of a Change in Control, or (B) the taking of any action by the Company which would adversely affect the Executive s participation in or materially reduce the Executive s benefits under the Benefit Plans or otherwise deprive the Executive of any material fringe benefit or perquisite of office enjoyed by the Executive at the time of a Change in Control of the Company considered in the aggregate with all benefits so provided to the Executive; 

(iv) (A) any failure by the Company to continue in effect any incentive plan or arrangement (including, without limitation, the Company s incentive bonus and contingent bonus arrangements and credits and the right to receive performance awards and similar long and short-term incentive compensation benefits) in which the 

Executive is participating at the time of a Change in Control of the Company (hereinafter referred to as Incentive Plans ), (B) the taking of any action by the Company which would adversely affect the Executive s participation in any such Incentive Plan or reduce the Executive s benefits under any such Incentive Plan, unless in the case of either subclause (A) or (B) above, there is substituted a comparable plan or program that is economically equivalent, in terms of the benefit offered to the Executive, to the Incentive Plan being altered, reduced, affected or ended, or (C) any failure by the Company with respect to any fiscal year to make an award to the Executive pursuant to each such Incentive Plan or such substituted comparable plan or program in accordance with its terms or otherwise in a manner consistent with awards or benefits provided to other executive officers of the Company; 

(v) (A) any failure by the Company to continue in effect any plan or arrangement to receive securities of the Company (including, without limitation, the Company's stock option plans and other equity incentive plans as authorized by the Board for the senior executive officers) in which the Executive is participating at the time of a Change in Control of the Company (hereinafter referred to as Securities Plans ), or the taking of any action by the Company which would adversely affect the Executive's participation in or materially reduce the Executive s benefits under any such Securities Plan or (B) any failure by the Company in any fiscal year to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights or securities awards to the Executive pursuant to such Securities Plans or otherwise in a manner consistent with awards or grants provided to other executive officers of the Company; and provided further that the material terms and conditions of such stock options, stock appreciation rights, and securities awards granted to the Executive after the Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the exercise price, vesting schedule, period and methods of exercise, expiration date, forfeiture provisions and other restrictions) are substantially similar to the material terms and conditions of the stock options, stock appreciation rights, and securities awards granted to the Executive under the Securities Plans immediately prior to the Change in Control of the Company; 

(vi) a relocation of the Company s principal executive offices to a location more than 100 miles outside of San Diego, California, or the Executive s relocation more than 100 miles from the location at which the Executive performed the Executive's duties prior to a Change in Control of the Company, except for required travel by the Executive on the Company s business to an extent substantially consistent with the Executive s business travel obligations at the time of a Change in Control of the Company; 

(vii) any failure by the Company to provide the Executive with the number of annual paid vacation days to which the Executive is entitled for the year in which a Change in Control of the Company occurs; 

(viii) any material breach by the Company of any provision of this Agreement; 

(ix) any failure by the Company to obtain the assumption of this Agreement by any successor or assign of the Company; 

(x) the Company or its successor no longer is required to have its common stock registered pursuant to Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; or
