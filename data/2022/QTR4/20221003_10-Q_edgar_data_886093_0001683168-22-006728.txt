NUNZIA PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY 

 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital
to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease
operations. 

In view of these conditions, the ability of the
Company to continue as a going concern is in doubt and dependent upon achieving a profitable level of operations and on the ability of
the Company to obtain necessary financing to fund ongoing operations. Historically, the Company has relied upon internally generated funds
and funds from the sale of shares of stock, issuance of promissory notes and loans from its shareholders and private investors to finance
its operations and growth. Management is planning to raise necessary additional funds for working capital through loans and/or additional
sales of its common stock. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising additional capital or that such
additional funds will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Should the Company be unable to raise this amount of capital its operating
plans will be limited to the amount of capital that it can access. These financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments which
will be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern and therefore be required to realize its assets and discharge
its liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts different from those reflected in the accompanying financial
statements.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations 

Forward-Looking Statements 

This Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking
statements which involve assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies, and expectations, and are generally identifiable by use
of words such as may, will, should, expect, anticipate, estimate, 
 believe, intend, or project, or the negative of these words or other variations on these words
or comparable terminology. These statements are expressed in good faith and based upon a reasonable basis when made, but there can be
no assurance that these expectations will be achieved or accomplished. 

Such forward-looking statements include statements
regarding, among other things, (a) the potential markets for our technologies, our potential profitability, and cash flows, (b) our growth
strategies, (c) expectations from our ongoing research and development activities, (d) anticipated trends in the technology industry,
(e) our future financing plans, and (f) our anticipated needs for working capital. This information may involve known and unknown risks,
uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from the future
results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. These statements may be found under Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as well as in this Form 10-Q generally. Actual events
or results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, without
limitation, the matters described in this Form 10-Q generally. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that
the forward-looking statements contained in this filing will in fact occur. In addition to the information expressly required to be included
in this filing, we will provide such further material information, if any, as may be necessary to make the required statements, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. 

Although forward-looking statements in this
report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to known and unknown risks,
business, economic and other risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from those discussed in
these forward-looking statements. Readers are urged not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only
as of the date of this report. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in order to reflect any event or circumstance
that may arise after the date of this report, other than as may be required by applicable law or regulation. Readers are urged to carefully
review and consider the various disclosures made by us in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission which attempt to advise
interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. If
one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if the underlying assumptions prove incorrect our actual results may vary
materially from those expected or projected. 

Except where the context otherwise requires
and for purposes of this Form 10-Q only, the terms we, us, our, Company our
Company, and Nunzia refer to Nunzia Pharmaceutical Company, a Utah corporation. 

Overview 

The Company owns the rights to Nunzia 
a nutraceutical that treats autism, fragile X, ADHD, and PTSD. We manufacture, market and distribute Nunzia direct to consumers
through our website, www.nunziapharma.com, and wholesalers. Nunzia is a targeted Blocker B that acts to increase sensory, social,
and daily living skills, as well as attention span, memory retention, focus, comprehension, and learning while decreasing anxiety, stress,
fixations, fidgeting, and outside detractions. Current drugs that attempt to control the symptoms of autism, fragile X, ADHD, and PTSD
are broad acting, usually ineffective and include such drugs as Valium, Prozac, amphetamines, and anti-psychotics. These drugs are considered
 Hit or Miss , singly or in combination. 

Going Concern 

The Company's financial statements are prepared
using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization
of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues
sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern.

Comparison of the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 ,
to the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021 

Operating Expenses 

Total operating expenses for the three months
ended June 30, 2022 was 20,100 compared to 6,629 for the three months ended June 30, 2021. Total operating expenses for the six months
ended June 30, 2022 was 20,100 compared to 18,743,230 for the six months ended June 30, 2021. 

The operating expenses for the six months ended
June 30, 2022 include 18,685,000 in stock based compensation compared to -0- for the comparable period in the prior year. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of June 30, 2022, we have no cash on hand,
negative working capital of 117,405 and an accumulated deficit of 198,156,360. Our operations are solely being funded by our President,
Mr. Mitsunaga. There are no assurance that he will continue to fund the Company or that alternate sources of financing can be obtained. 

These conditions raise substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. Management recognizes that in order for us to meet our capital requirements, and continue
to operate, additional financing will be necessary. We expect to raise additional funds through private or public equity investment in
order to maintain and/or expand the range and scope of our business operations; however, there is no assurance that such additional funds
will be available for us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed or generate positive
cash flow, it is unlikely that we will be able to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Other Contractual Obligations 

None. 

Recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

See Note 1 to our consolidated financial
statements. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant
Judgments and Use of Estimates 

Management s discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements required the use of estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, and expenses. Management bases estimates on historical experience
and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an on-going basis. Actual
results may differ from these estimates. There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates included
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the three months ended June 30, 2022.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

At the end of the period covered by this quarterly
report, the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer of the Company (the Certifying Officer conducted an evaluation
of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. As defined under Sections 240.13a-15(e) and 240.15d-15(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), the term disclosure controls and procedures means
controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to the issuer s management, including the Certifying Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

The management of the Company is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Our management assessed the effectiveness
of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this report. The framework used
by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, our CEO and
CFO have determined and concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s internal control over
financial reporting was not effective. 

As defined by Auditing Standard No. 5, An
Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that is Integrated with an Audit of Financial Statements and Related Independence Rule
and Conforming Amendments, established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB ), a material weakness
is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies that result in a more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. In connection with the assessment described above, management identified
the following control deficiencies that represent material weaknesses as of the end of the period covered by this report: 

The Company does not have policies and procedures or accounting systems in place to ensure the timely review, disclosure and accurate financial reporting for significant agreements and transactions. 

The Company does not have an independent audit committee in place, which would provide oversight of the Company s officers, operations and financial reporting function. 

14 

As of June 30, 2022 are internal controls over
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Due to our small size, we were not able to immediately take any action to remediate
these material weaknesses. Notwithstanding the assessment that our Internal Controls over Financial Reporting was not effective and that
there were material weaknesses identified herein as of June 30, 2022, we believe that our financial statements contained in this Annual
Report fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the years covered thereby in all material respects. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered
by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of June 30, 2022.
