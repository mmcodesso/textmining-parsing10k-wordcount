The loan was made pursuant to a PPP Promissory Note and Agreement. Loans obtained through the PPP are eligible to be forgiven as long as the proceeds are used for qualifying purposes and certain other conditions are met. The receipt of these funds, and the forgiveness of the loan was dependent on the Company having initially qualified for the loan and qualifying for the forgiveness of such loan based on its adherence to the forgiveness criteria.

On February 24, 2021, the Company terminated the 2017 Plan and adopted the 2020 Plan (defined below). 
 
 2020 Plan 
 On October 23, 2020, the Board approved and on November 19, 2020 the stockholders approved the Byrna Technologies Inc. 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan ). The aggregate number of shares of common stock available for issuance in connection with options and other awards granted under the 2020 Plan was .

The 2020 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board. The Compensation Committee determines the persons to whom options to purchase shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights SARs ), restricted stock units RSUs ), and restricted or unrestricted shares of common stock may be granted. Persons eligible to receive awards under the 2020 Plan are employees, officers, directors, consultants, advisors and other individual service providers of the Company. Awards are at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. 
 
 On February 24, 2021, following the termination of the 2017 Plan, the Company replaced outstanding options under the 2017 Plan with options under the 2020 Plan. In connection with the adoption of the 2020 Plan, the Company cancelled outstanding option awards granted under the 2017 plan. There were no substantive changes to the rights of any holder of options granted under the 2017 plan other than replacing their award certificates with award agreements under the 2020 plan. The grant dates, exercise prices, expiration dates, and vesting provisions of any of the new award agreements under the 2020 plan that replace the certificates issued under the 2017 plan are identical for each grant and no change in valuation or accounting was required. The Board also amended the definition of Disability in the 2020 Plan to provide that Disability has the meaning assigned to such term in any individual employment agreement or award agreement with a plan participant and that if no such definition is provided in an award or employment agreement Disability is defined as in the 2020 Plan. 

Stock-Based Compensation Expense 
 Total stock-based compensation expense was million and million for the nine months ended August 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. Total stock-based compensation expense was million and million for the three months ended August 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. Total stock-based compensation expense was recorded in Operating expenses in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 
 
 During the first half of 2022, the Board of Directors authorized granting of restricted stock unit awards (" RSUs") in excess of the limit stipulated under the 2020 Plan. Additionally, the Company agreed to grant RSUs to the Chief Technology Officer ("CTO") in exchange for his waiver of rights to future royalty payments. See Note 21, "Commitments and Contingencies - Royalty Payments," for additional information. Because these awards were contingent on shareholder approval at the next annual shareholder meeting, these RSUs were not considered granted under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation ("ASC 718" and were treated as obligation to issue RSU's and were remeasured at the end of each reporting period until the settlement date on June 17, 2022 and August 3, 2022 for the RSUs to the CTO). 
 
 Additionally, on March 23, 2022, the Board of Directors approved the issuance of RSU Amendment Agreements to each grantee of the double trigger RSUs in which of the RSUs RSUs) were exchanged for stock options. In accordance with ASC 718 , a cancellation of an award accompanied by the concurrent grant of a replacement award shall be accounted for as a modification of the terms of the cancelled award. Similarly, because these stock options were not considered granted under ASC 718, they were therefore treated as obligation to issue stock options and were remeasured at the end of each reporting period until the settlement date on June 17, 2022. 
 
 On June 17, 2022, the stockholders approved to increase the stock compensation plan by shares to shares. Consequently, the Company settled the obligation to issue RSUs and options by issuing the related RSUs and stock options and reclassified the fair value of the issuances at June 17, 2022 of million from accounts payable and accrued liabilities to additional paid-in capital. Additionally, the amounts recognized as employee incentive expense for the three months ended August 31, 2022 and 2021 of and million, respectively, were reclassified to stock compensation expense. The non-cash expense associated with these rewards were valued at the grant date of June 17, 2022, using a Monte Carlo model for double trigger RSUs and a Black Scholes model for simple employment period vesting stock options. 
 
 Restricted Stock Units

Stock-based compensation expense for the RSUs for the three months ended August 31, 2022 and 2021 , was million and million, respectively. 
 
 During the nine months ended August 31, 2022 , the Company accelerated the vesting of RSUs to a former director and RSUs to current board members for 2021 services. During the nine months ended August 31, 2022 , RSUs were forfeited due to a former employee who was terminated for cause. These RSU's did not vest, as they were based on triggers and performance that were not met. As a result, no expenses were reversed, and going forward no expenses will be recognized. The forfeited RSUs were returned to the pool of shares available for issuance under the 2020 Plan. 
 
 As of August 31, 2022 , there was million of unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to unvested RSUs which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average of years.

 During the nine months ended August 31, 2022 and 2021 , the Company granted options to employees and directors to purchase and shares of common stock, respectively. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense for options granted to its employees and directors of million and million during the nine months ended August 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense for options granted to its employees and directors of million and million during the three months ended August 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. 
 
 As of August 31, 2022 , there was million of unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to unvested stock options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years. 
 
 Stock Option Valuation 
 The fair value of stock options at the date of grant was estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The expected volatility is based upon historical volatility of the Company's stock. The expected term for the options is based upon observation of actual time elapsed between employees. The assumption that the Company used to determine the grant-date fair value of stock options granted for the nine months ended nine months ended August 31, 2022 were as follows: 

Expected dividends 0.0 
 Expected volatility 
 Expected life (in years) 
 Market price of the Company s common stock on date of grant

The Company s potential dilutive securities, which may include stock options, unvested restricted stock units, convertible preferred stock, and outstanding warrants to purchase shares of common stock, have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share as the effect would be to reduce the net loss per share. Therefore, the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same. 
 
 The following potential common shares, presented based on amounts outstanding at each period end, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the periods indicated because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect:

 COVID- 19 Pandemic and CARES Act 
 On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization WHO announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China (the COVID- 19 outbreak and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally beyond its point of origin. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID- 19 outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. 
 
 The full impact of the COVID- 19 outbreak continues to evolve as of the date of this report. As such, it is uncertain as to the full magnitude that the pandemic may have on the Company s financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations. Management is actively monitoring the impact of the global situation on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce. Given the daily evolution of the COVID- 19 outbreak and the global responses to curb its spread, the Company is not able to estimate the effects of the COVID- 19 outbreak on its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity for fiscal year 2022. 
 
 The Company faces various risks related to COVID- 19 outbreak. The Company is dependent on its workforce to deliver its products. If significant portions of the Company s workforce are unable to work effectively, or if customers operations are curtailed due to illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures, or other restrictions in connection with the COVID- 19 pandemic, the Company s operations will likely be impacted. The Company may be unable to perform fully on its contracts and costs may increase as a result of the COVID- 19 outbreak. These cost increases may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance. Since the COVID- 19 outbreak began, no facilities have been fully shut down. Certain of the Company s vendors may be unable to deliver materials on time due to the COVID- 19 outbreak. Such delays may negatively impact the Company s production, and the Company plans to continue to monitor these and its other vendors and, if necessary, seek alternative suppliers. 
 
 Legal Proceedings 
 In the ordinary course of our business, the Company may be subject to certain other legal actions and claims, including product liability, consumer, commercial, tax and governmental matters, which may arise from time to time. The Company does not believe it is currently a party to any pending legal proceedings. Notwithstanding, legal proceedings are subject-to inherent uncertainties, and an unfavorable outcome could include monetary damages, and excessive verdicts can result from litigation, and as such, could result in a material adverse impact on the Company s business, financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. Additionally, although the Company has specific insurance for certain potential risks, the Company may in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims which may have a material adverse impact on the Company s business, financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows.

million and million related to the South African rand during the three months ended August 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. The Company recorded a translation adjustment loss of million and translation adjustment gain of million during the nine months ended August 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 The Company s South African subsidiary revenues, cost of goods sold, operating costs and capital expenditures are denominated in South African rand. Consequently, fluctuations in the U.S. dollar exchange rate against the South African rand increases the volatility of sales, cost of goods sold and operating costs and overall net earnings when translated into U.S. dollars. The Company is not using any forward or option contracts to fix the foreign exchange rates. Using a fluctuation in the U.S. exchange rate, the impact on the loss and stockholders equity (deficit) is not material. 

ii) 
 Credit Risk 

Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation. The financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash with high credit quality financial institutions located in the U.S. and South Africa. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions in the U.S. in excess of amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
 
 The Company provides credit to its customers in the normal course of its operations. It carries out, on a continuing basis, credit checks on its customers.

 OVERVIEW 
 
 The following discussion and analysis is intended to help you understand us, our operations and our financial performance. It should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are included in Item 1 of this report. 
 
 Byrna Technologies is a designer, manufacturer, retailer and distributor of innovative technological solutions for security situations that do not require the use of lethal force. Our mantra is Live Safe , and our core mission is to empower individuals to safely and fully engage in life and adventure. Our design team s directive is to build easy-to-use self-defense tools to enhance the safety of our customers and their loved ones at home and outdoors. We are also focused on developing tools that can be used instead of firearms by professional law enforcement and private security customers to reduce shootings and facilitate trust between police and the communities they seek to serve. Our strategy is to establish Byrna as a consumer lifestyle brand associated with the confidence people can achieve by knowing they can protect themselves, their loved ones and those around them. We believe we have a significant opportunity to leverage the Byrna brand to expand our product line, broaden our user base and generate increasing sales from new and existing customers. 

22

Our business strategy is twofold: (1) to fulfill the growing demand for less-lethal products in the law enforcement, correctional services, and private security markets and (2) to provide civilians including those whose work or daily activities may put them at risk of being a victim with easy access to an effective, non-lethal way to protect themselves and their loved ones from threats to their person or property. 
 
 We believe that the United States, along with many other parts of the world, is experiencing a significant spike in the demand for less-lethal products and that the less-lethal market will be one of the faster growing segments of the security market over the next decade, particularly given the fear caused by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The less lethal market has been projected to approach 12 billion per year by 2023 (Statistics MRC. Non-Lethal Weapons Global Market Outlook (2017-2023)). We plan to respond to this demand for less-lethal products through the serial production and distribution of the Byrna SD and expansion of the Byrna product line. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Results for the third quarter of 2022 demonstrate a continuing demand for our Byrna SD personal security device and growth of the production capacity and administrative and control structures necessary to supply that demand. Revenue increased to 12.4 million from 8.7 million in the third quarter of last year. Most of the growth in revenue continues to be in high margin direct sales or Amazon, as e-commerce orders accounted for 65.3 of total net revenue this quarter. In addition, the Company introduced products from Fox Labs, which the Company acquired at the end of the second quarter of this year. Sales related to Fox Lab branded products totaled 0.4 million in the third quarter of 2022. 
 
 Over the past year, the structural growth required to manage a larger company with higher sales volumes has required an increase in structural operating expenses such as payroll, insurance and marketing expenses. We also incur expenses associated with operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq, insurance expenses, audit expenses, investor relations activities, Sarbanes-Oxley compliance expenses and other administrative expenses and professional services. 
 
 Three months ended August 31, 2022 as compared to three months ended August 31, 2021: 
 
 Net Revenue 
 Revenues were 12.4 million in the third quarter of 2022 which represents an increase of 3.7 million or 42.7 as compared to the prior year period revenues of 8.7 million. Website sales, increased by 2.4 million from 5.7 million in the third quarter of 2021 to 8.1 million in the third quarter of 2022. This increase includes a 1.7 million increase in Amazon sales. Additionally, sales through all other channels, with the exception of law enforcement, increased in comparison with the same quarter of the prior year. International sales increased by 0.5 million from 1.6 million in the third quarter of 2021 to 2.1 million in the third quarter of 2022 due to a strong quarter for exports to Asia and Latin America. Sales to domestic dealers/distributors increased from 1.2 million in the third quarter of 2021 to 1.7 million in the third quarter of 2022. In addition, Fox Labs, which was acquired on May 25, 2022, added 0.4 million in sales pepper sprays the third quarter of 2022. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 Cost of goods sold was 5.5 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 3.8 million in the prior year period. This 1.7 million increase is primarily due to the increase in related sales volume. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit is calculated as total revenue less cost of goods sold and gross margin is calculated as gross profit divided by total revenue. Included as cost of goods sold are costs associated with the production and procurement of products, such as labor and overhead, inbound freight costs, manufacturing depreciation, purchasing and receiving costs, and inspection costs. Gross profit was 6.9 million in the third quarter of 2022, or 55.4 of net revenue, as compared to gross profit of approximately 4.9 million, or 56.2 of net revenue, in the prior year period. While improvements in shipping efficiency lowered freight costs and improved gross profit by approximately 1 , one-time increases to inventory reserves decreased gross profit by approximately 2 . 

23

Operating Expenses / Income (Loss) from Operations 
 Operating expenses were 8.3 million in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 1.6 million, as compared to the prior year period expenses of 6.7 million. This increase is due to the growth of the Company. 
 
 During fiscal year 2021, management made the strategic decision to support continued revenue growth through increased marketing expenditure which increased 0.8 million to 1.4 million for the third quarter of 2022 as compared to 0.6 million in the third quarter of 2021. 
 
 The structural growth required to manage a larger business with higher sales volumes drove up structural costs. Payroll related costs increased 0.3 million from 3.6 million in the third quarter of 2021 to 3.9 million in the third quarter of 2022, mainly due to the increase in stock compensation expense. IT subscriptions increased 0.1 million from 0.03 million in the third quarter of 2021 to 0.2 million in the third quarter of 2022. 
 
 Income Tax Provision 
 For the three months ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded an income tax expense of 0.2 million and an income tax benefit of 0.1 million, respectively. For the three months ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, the effective tax rate was (10.8 and 3.9 , respectively. The Company s tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 21.0 due to the effects of state taxes net of federal benefit, the foreign tax rate differential as a result of Byrna South Africa, effects of permanent non-deductible expenses, the recording of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets generated in the current period, and other effects. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we provide the following additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP (non-GAAP): adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP adjusted net loss, and non-GAAP adjusted net loss per share. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures help us to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of certain expenses that we exclude in the calculations of the non-GAAP financial measures. 
 
 Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business and provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects. 
 
 These non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations in the use of non-GAAP measures, because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under GAAP and because they involve the exercise of judgment concerning exclusions of items from the comparable non-GAAP financial measure. In addition, other companies may use other non-GAAP measures to evaluate their performance, or may calculate non-GAAP measures differently, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison.

Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income excluding the impact of (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) income tax provision (benefit); (iii) interest income (expense); (iv) stock-based compensation expense; and (v) other expenses. Our Adjusted EBITDA measure eliminates potential differences in performance caused by variations in capital structures (affecting finance costs), tax positions, the cost and age of tangible assets (affecting relative depreciation expense) and the extent to which intangible assets are identifiable (affecting relative amortization expense). We also exclude certain one-time and non-cash costs. Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is as follows (in thousands):

Nine months ended August 31, 2022 as compared to nine months ended August 31, 2021: 
 
 Net Revenue 
 Revenues were 32.0 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2022 which represents an increase of 1.0 million as compared to the prior year period revenues of 31.0 million. The prior year period sales included the fulfillment of approximately 4.0 million of backorders received in fiscal year 2020 and a surge in the Company's website sales due to the Company's product being featured on a national news program in April of 2021. Thus, website sales (excluding Amazon) decreased by 6.3 million from 23.9 million in nine months ended August 31, 2021 to 17.6 million in nine months ended August 31, 2022. However, sales through all other channels increased year over year. International sales increased by 2.4 million from 2.5 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2021 to 4.9 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2022. This increase was driven by new customers in South America and Asia. Sales via Amazon were 3.7 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2022 compared to 0.05 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2021, before that site had been established. Sales to domestic dealers/distributors, and retail sales to large end-users such as security companies and law enforcement agencies increased from 4.5 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2021 to 5.5 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2022. In addition, Fox Labs, which was acquired on May 25, 2022, added 0.4 million in sales of pepper sprays in the nine months ended August 31, 2022. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 Cost of goods sold was 14.4 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2022 compared to 13.8 million in the prior year period. This 0.6 million increase is primarily due to the increase in related sales volume. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit is calculated as total revenue less cost of goods sold and gross margin is calculated as gross profit divided by total revenue. Included as cost of goods sold are costs associated with the production and procurement of products, such as labor and overhead, inbound freight costs, manufacturing depreciation, purchasing and receiving costs, and inspection costs. Gross profit was 17.6 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2022, or 55.0 of net revenue, as compared to gross profit of approximately 17.2 million, or 55.5 of net revenue, in the prior year period. 

25

Operating Expenses / Income (Loss) from Operations 
 Operating expenses were 25.0 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year period expenses of 17.4 million. This 7.7 million increase is due to the growth of the Company. 
 
 During fiscal year 2021, management made the strategic decision to support continued revenue growth through increased marketing expenditure which increased 2.6 million to 3.9 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2022 as compared to 1.3 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2021. 
 
 The structural growth required to manage a larger business with higher sales volumes drove up structural costs. Payroll related costs increased 3.0 million from 9.6 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2021 to 12.6 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2022. The increase was mostly due to an increase in non-cash stock compensation which increased by 1.6 million from 2.5 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2021 to 4.1 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2022. Salary, wages and bonuses increased by 1.2 million from 5.9 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2021 to 7.1 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2022. 
 
 IT subscriptions increased 0.4 million from 0.06 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2021 to 0.5 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2022. 
 
 Income Tax Provision 
 For the nine months ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded an income tax provision of 0.1 million and 0.1 million, respectively. For the nine months ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, the effective tax rate was (1.1 and 320.6 , respectively. The Company s tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 21.0 due to the effects of state taxes net of federal benefit, the foreign tax rate differential as a result of Byrna South Africa, effects of permanent non-deductible expenses, the recording of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets generated in the current period, and other effects. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we provide the following additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP (non-GAAP): adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP adjusted net loss, and non-GAAP adjusted net loss per share. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures help us to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of certain expenses that we exclude in the calculations of the non-GAAP financial measures. 
 
 Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business and provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects. 
 
 These non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations in the use of non-GAAP measures, because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under GAAP and because they involve the exercise of judgment concerning exclusions of items from the comparable non-GAAP financial measure. In addition, other companies may use other non-GAAP measures to evaluate their performance, or may calculate non-GAAP measures differently, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison.

Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income excluding the impact of (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) income tax provision (benefit); (iii) interest income (expense); (iv) stock-based compensation expense; and (v) other expenses. Our Adjusted EBITDA measure eliminates potential differences in performance caused by variations in capital structures (affecting finance costs), tax positions, the cost and age of tangible assets (affecting relative depreciation expense) and the extent to which intangible assets are identifiable (affecting relative amortization expense). We also exclude certain one-time and non-cash costs. Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is as follows (in thousands):

Non-GAAP adjusted net loss per share 
 
 Non-GAAP adjusted net loss is defined as net (loss) income as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income excluding the impact of (i) stock-based compensation expense and (ii) other expenses. Our non-GAAP adjusted net loss measure eliminates potential differences in performance caused by certain non-cash and one-time costs. We also provide non-GAAP adjusted net loss per share by dividing non-GAAP adjusted net loss by the average basic shares outstanding for the period. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP adjusted (loss) income to net (loss) income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is as follows (in thousands):

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Cash Flow Summary 
 Cash as of August 31, 2022 totaled 24.5 million a decrease of 31.9 million from 56.4 million of cash and restricted cash as of November 30, 2021. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash used in operating activities was 12.8 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2022 compared to cash used in operations of 3.3 million during the prior year period. Net loss was 1.5 million and 7.8 million for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2022. Net loss was 1.8 million and 0.1 million for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2021. Significant changes in noncash and working capital activity are as follows: 
 
 Our non-cash activity adds back several non-cash items to net loss to calculate cash used in operations in the nine months ended August 31, 2022. These include stock-based expenses of 4.1 million, compared to 2.5 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2021; depreciation and amortization of 0.6 million compared to 0.4 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2021. 
 
 During the nine months ended August 31, 2022, the growth of the Company was reflected in the use of cash for growing working capital needs. Inventory increased during the nine months ended August 31, 2022 by 8.9 million, compared to 2.3 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2021. The increase in inventory is a planned measure to ensure we have the ability to meet demand during the remainder of 2022. Accounts receivable decreased by 1.0 million during the nine months ended August 31, 2022 , due to decreased accounts receivables in South Africa, as compared to an increase of 0.4 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2021. Deferred revenue increased 0.2 during the nine months ended August 31, 2022, compared to a decrease of 4.2 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2021 as we fulfilled backlogged e-commerce orders. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities was 4.2 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2022, compared to 4.9 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2021. The current year investing activities relate to purchase of property and equipment and the Fox Labs acquisition. The prior year investing activities relate to the Mission Less Lethal and Ballistipax acquisitions. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash used by financing activities was 14.5 million during the nine months ended August 31, 2022, compared to cash provided by 57.2 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2021. The nine months ended August 31, 2022 amount was primarily composed of stock repurchased of 15.0 million compared to 56.8 million from proceeds from the sale of common stock during the nine months ended August 31, 2021. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
 
 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 
 See Note 5, Recent Accounting Guidance, in the Notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this report for a discussion of recently issued and adopted accounting standards. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 4, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of the 2021 10-K. During the three and nine months ended August 31, 2022, there were no significant changes to the Company s critical accounting policies from those described in our 2021 10-K.

ITEM 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2022 pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. The Company s CEO and CFO concluded that as of August 31, 2022, due to the material weakness described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 
 
 Previously Reported Material Weakness 
 
 As disclosed in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 11, 2022, we previously identified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to controls over user access within the Company s ERP system. 
 
 The material weakness noted is that the Company did not design and maintain effective controls over user access within the Company s enterprise resources planning ERP system, SAP Business One, to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and to adequately restrict user access to appropriate personnel. Specifically, certain users were deemed to have excessive access rights within the ERP system. Therefore, a material weakness in the design and operating effectiveness of the internal controls over information technology was identified as of November 30, 2021. 
 
 This material weakness did not result in any material misstatement in our financial statements or disclosures. Based on additional procedures and post-closing review, management concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
 
 Remediation Plan 
 
 We have modified the designated SAP Business One access rights for each employee for which a conflict has been identified to remove any responsibilities deemed to be excessive or otherwise inappropriate for the employee s job function and are in the process of determining the effectiveness of our remediation. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes that occurred during the first quarter of 2022, except for those related to our remediation plans, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

In the normal course of business, the Company occasionally becomes involved in various legal proceedings. The results of any such proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty because such matters are inherently uncertain. Significant damages or penalties may be sought in some matters, and some matters may require years to resolve. In our opinion, at this time, any liability from such proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the Company. 

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS 

Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this report include the Risk Factors in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 11, 2022. As of the date of this Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

ITEM 2. 
 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 

On February 15, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a plan to buy back up to 10.0 million worth of shares of the Company's common stock from the open market Stock Buyback Plan ). The Stock Buyback Plan was used to return capital to shareholders and to minimize the dilutive impact of stock options and other share-based awards. Our Company's Board of Directors specified an expiration date of the sooner of April 30, 2022 or upon reaching the aggregate limit of 10.0 million for the repurchases under the Stock Buyback Plan. The Company completed the full 10.0 million for the repurchases during March 2022. No repurchases were made during the third fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2022. 
 
 On April 28, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a plan to buy back up to an additional 5.0 million worth of shares of our common stock. We completed the full 5.0 million repurchase of shares during May 2022. See Note 15 of our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding our Stock Buyback Program .
