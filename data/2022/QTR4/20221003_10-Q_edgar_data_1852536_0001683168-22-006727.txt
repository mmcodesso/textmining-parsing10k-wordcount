as of August 31, 2022 and as of February 28, 2022. The Company currently has losses
and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period
of time. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management anticipates
that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses The Company intends
to position in the matter so that it will be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management s
efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and
continue as a going concern. 

The extent of the impact of the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak on the financial performance of the Company will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak
and related advisories and restrictions and the impact of COVID-19 on the overall economy, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot
be predicted. If the overall economy is impacted for an extended period, the Company s future operating results May be materially
adversely affected.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION 

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Statements made in this Form 10-Q that are not
historical or current facts are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933 (the Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements often can be identified
by the use of terms such as May, will, expect, believe, anticipate, estimate, 
 approximate or continue, or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to
the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what May occur in the future.
However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual
results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected.
We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of
such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. 

Employees
and Employment Agreements 

At present, we have no employees other than our
officer and director. We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans;
however, we May adopt such plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to any officers, directors or employees. 

Results of Operation 

Our financial statements have been prepared assuming
that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of
assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 

We expect we will require additional capital to
meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt
securities. 

Three Months Ended August 31, 2022 and 202: 

During the three and six months ended August 31,
2022, we have not generated any revenues. 

Our net loss for the three and six months ended
August 31, 2022 was 5,943 and 16,362. Operating expenses consist of mainly professional fees, consulting expenses and depreciation expenses. 

During three and six months ended August 31, 2021,
we have not generated any revenues. 

Our net loss for the three and six months ended
August 31, 2021 was 4,406 and 11,005. Operating expenses consist of mainly professional fees, consulting expenses and depreciation expenses. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of August 31, 2022, our total assets were 8,958
consisting of company website 4,999 and cash 3,959 held at Escrow account. As of August 31, 2022, our current liabilities were 24,879
consisting of related party loans of 6,379 and accounts payable 18,500. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

We have not generated positive cash flows from
operating activities. For six months ended August 31, 2022, net cash flows used in operating activities was 12,028. For six months ended
August 31, 2021, net cash flows used in operating activities was 6,505. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

We did not generate any cash flows from investing
activities for the six-month period ended August 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

We have generated cash flows from financing activities
for six months ending August 31, 2022 in the amount of 139 from director loan. We have generated positive cash flows from financing activities
for six months ended August 31, 2021, of 29,049 representing cash proceeds from related party loans. 

Plan of Operation and Funding 

We expect that working capital requirements will
continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements
are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. 

Existing working capital, further advances and
debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next three months. We have no
lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private
placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating
expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business;
and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter,
we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances
of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights,
preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing May not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate
funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we May not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors
or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. We will have to raise additional funds in
the next twelve months in order to sustain and expand our operations. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such
funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. We
have and will continue to seek to obtain short-term loans from our directors, although no future arrangement for additional loans has
been made. We do not have any agreements with our directors concerning these loans. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future
equity financing. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do
not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
are material to investors. 

Going Concern 

The financial statements have been prepared assuming
that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments
in the ordinary course of business. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

No report required. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that
is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management,
including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision
and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of August 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was
no change in our internal control over financial reporting since Inception on January 4, 2021 ended August 31, 2022 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

contemplated by any governmental authority or any other party involving us or our properties. As of the date of this Quarterly Report,
no director, officer or affiliate is (i) a party adverse to us in any legal proceeding, or (ii) has an adverse interest to us in any legal
