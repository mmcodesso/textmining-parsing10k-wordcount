NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, that are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management, and which statements
involve substantial risk and uncertainties. All statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q other than statements of historical
fact, including statements regarding our future operating results and financial position, our business strategy and plans, market growth
and trends, and objectives for future operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future
events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain
words such as may, will, should, expects, plans, anticipates, 
 could, intends, target, projects, contemplates, believes, 
 estimates, predicts, potential, or continue or the negative of these words or
other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. 

These risks and uncertainties include, among other things, risks related
to our expectations regarding the impact of the coronavirus pandemic (the COVID-19 pandemic ), including the easing of related
regulations and measures as the pandemic and its related effects begin to abate or have abated, on our business, results of operations,
financial condition, and future profitability and growth; our expectations regarding the impact of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic on the
businesses of our customers, partners and suppliers, and the economy, as well as the macro- and micro-effects of the pandemic and differing
levels of demand for our products as our customers priorities, resources, financial conditions and economic outlook change; global
macro-economic conditions, including the effects of inflation, rising interest rates and market volatility on the global economy; our
ability to estimate the size of our total addressable market, and the development of the market for our products, which is new and evolving;
our ability to effectively sustain and manage our growth and future expenses, achieve and maintain future profitability, attract new customers
and maintain and expand our existing customer base; our ability to scale and update our platform to respond to customers needs
and rapid technological change; the effects of increased competition in our market and our ability to compete effectively; our ability
to expand use cases within existing customers and vertical solutions; our ability to expand our operations and increase adoption of our
platform internationally; our ability to strengthen and foster our relationships with developers; our ability to expand our direct sales
force, customer success team and strategic partnerships around the world; the impact of any data breaches, cyberattacks or other malicious
activity on our technology systems; our ability to identify targets for and execute potential acquisitions; our ability to successfully
integrate the operations of businesses we may acquire, and to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions; our ability to maintain,
protect and enhance our brand; the sufficiency of our cash, cash equivalents and capital resources to satisfy our liquidity needs; limitations
on us due to obligations we have under our credit facility or other indebtedness; our failure or the failure of our software to comply
with applicable industry standards, laws and regulations; our ability to maintain, protect and enhance our intellectual property; our
ability to successfully defend litigation against us; our ability to attract large organizations as users; our ability to maintain our
corporate culture; our ability to offer high-quality customer support; our ability to hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel, including
executive level management; our ability to successfully manage and integrate executive management transitions; our ability to estimate
the size and potential growth of our target market; uncertainties regarding the impact of general economic and market conditions, including
as a result of regional and global conflicts or related government sanctions; our ability to successfully implement and maintain new and
existing information technology systems, including our ERP system; and our ability to maintain proper and effective internal controls. 

You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions
of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current
expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations,
and prospects. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors
described in the section titled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation
to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to conform such statements to actual
results or revised expectations, except as required by law.

accrues on the unpaid principal balance computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. Commencing seven
months after the effective date of the PPP Loan, the Company is required to pay the Lender equal monthly payments of principal and interest
as required to fully amortize any unforgiven principal balance of the loan by the two-year anniversary of the effective date of the PPP
Loan (the Maturity Date ). The PPP Loan contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults,
making materially false or misleading representations to the SBA or the Lender, or breaching the terms of the PPP Loan. The occurrence
of an event of default may result in the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the PPP Loan, collection of all amounts owing from
the Company, or filing suit and obtaining judgment against the Company. Under the terms of the CARES Act, PPP loan recipients can apply
for and be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of the loan granted under the PPP. Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to
limitations, based on the use of loan proceeds for payment of payroll costs and any payments of mortgage interest, rent, and utilities.
Recent modifications to the PPP by the U.S. Treasury and Congress have extended the time period for loan forgiveness beyond the original
eight-week period, making it possible for the Company to apply for forgiveness of its PPP loan.

You should read the following discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related
notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial
statements included in our Prospectus on Form S-1. As discussed in the section titled Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions
that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such

below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors in our Prospectus filed on Form S-1 (File No: 333-261937). 

Business 

Reborn Coffee is focused on serving high quality, specialty-roasted
coffee at retail locations, kiosks and cafes. We are an innovative company that strives for constant improvement in the coffee experience
through exploration of new technology and premier service, guided by traditional brewing techniques. We believe Reborn differentiates
itself from other coffee roasters through its innovative techniques, including sourcing, washing, roasting, and brewing our coffee beans
with a balance of precision and craft. 

Founded in 2015 by Jay Kim, our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Kim and
his team launched Reborn Coffee with the vision of using the finest pure ingredients and pristine water. We currently serve customers
through our retail store locations in California: Brea, La Crescenta, Glendale, Corona Del Mar, Arcadia, Laguna Woods, Riverside, San
Francisco and Manhattan Beach, with four other locations in development. Additionally, we expect to begin franchising in 2022 and expect
to continue to develop additional retail locations as we expand outside of California. We estimate that the average development cost of
a company-owned retail location is approximately 150,000. Therefore, taking into account the proceeds from this offering and within a
year from its completion, we expect to open up to 20 company-owned retail locations (using approximately 3,000,000 of the proceeds of
this offering) and 20 franchise locations (all costs and expenses associated with a franchise store location development are borne by
the franchisees). We acknowledge that we have not yet signed any franchise agreements and that such number of franchise locations is purely
speculative. Reborn Coffee continues to elevate the high-end coffee experience and we received 1st place traditional still in America s
Best Cold Brew competition by Coffee Fest in 2017 in Portland and 2018 in Los Angeles. 

The Experience, Reborn 

As leading pioneers of the emerging Fourth Wave movement,
Reborn Coffee is redefining specialty coffee as an experience that demands much more than premium quality. We consider ourselves leaders
of the fourth wave coffee movement because we are constantly developing our bean processing methods, researching design
concepts, and reinventing new ways of drinking coffee. For instance, the current transition from the K-Cup trend to the pour over drip
concept allowed us to reinvent the way people consume coffee, by merging convenience and quality. We took the pour over drip concept and
made it available and affordable to the public through our Reborn Coffee Pour Over packs. Our Pour Over Packs allow our consumers to consume
our specialty coffee outdoors and on-the-go. 

Our success in innovating within the fourth wave coffee
movement is measured by our success in B2B sales with our introduction of Reborn Coffee Pour Over Packs to hotels. With the introduction
of our Pour Over Packs to major hotels (including one hotel company with 7 locations), our B2B sales increased as these companies recognized
the convenience and functionality our Pour Over Packs serve to their customers. 

Reborn Coffee s continuous Research and Development is essential
to developing new parameters in the production of new blends. Our 1st place position in America s Best Cold Brew competition
by Coffee Fest in 2017 in Portland and 2018 in Los Angeles is a testament to the way we believe we lead the fourth wave 
movement by example. 

Centered around its core values of service, trust, and well-being,
Reborn Coffee delivers an appreciation of coffee as both a science and an art. Developing innovative processes such as washing green coffee
beans with magnetized water, we challenge traditional preparation methods by focusing on the relationship between water chemistry, health,
and flavor profile. Leading research studies, testing brewing equipment, and refining roasting/brewing methods to a specific, Reborn Coffee
proactively distinguishes exceptional quality from good quality by starting at the foundation and paying attention to the details. Our
mission places an equal emphasis on humanizing the coffee experience, delivering a fresh take on farm-to-table by sourcing
internationally. In this way, Reborn Coffee creates opportunities to develop transparency by paying homage to origin stories and spark
new conversations by building cross-cultural communities united by a passion for the finest coffee. 

Through a broad product offering, Reborn Coffee provides customers
with a wide variety of beverages and coffee options. As a result, we believe we can capture share of any experience where customers seek
to consume great beverages whether in our inviting store atmospheres which are designed for comfort, or on the go through our pour over
packs, or at home with our whole bean ground coffee bags. We believe that the retail coffee market in the US is large and growing. According
to IBIS, in 2021, the retail market for coffee in the United States is expected to be 46.2 billion. This is expected to grow due to a
shift in consumer preferences to premium coffee, including specialized blends, espresso-based beverages, and cold brew options. Reborn
aims to capture a growing portion of the market as we expand and increase consumer awareness of our brand.

Plan of Operation 

We have a production and distribution center at our headquarters that
we use to process and roast coffee for wholesale and retail distribution. 

Currently, we have the following nine retail coffee locations, and
four locations in development (i.e., Cabazon, Huntington Beach, Irvine and Mission Viejo, California): 

La Floresta Shopping Village in Brea, California; 

La Crescenta, California; 

Glendale Galleria in Glendale, California; 

Galleria at Tyler in Riverside, California; 

Home Depot Center in Laguna Woods, California; 

Stonestown Galleria in San Francisco, California (opened in first quarter of 2022); 

Corona Del Mar, California; 

Santa Anita Westfield Mall in Arcadia, California; and 

Manhattan Village at Manhattan Beach, California. 

Impact of COVID-19 

The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting disruptions including, without
limitation, governmental lockdown mandates and restrictions, made 2020 a challenging year for businesses, particularly in the foodservice
and restaurant industries. Reborn Coffee took immediate action to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers including
the implementation of all operating protocols dictated by state and local guidelines and instituting strict health and safety practices.
Fortunately, we did not experience any significant disruptions in our supply chain operations. 

Despite efforts to ensure a safe consumer experience, we did experience
repressed customer flow through periods when malls and shopping centers were restricted or closed entirely due to governmental lockdown
mandates and restrictions. Our current retail locations are within popular shopping areas with anticipated regular customer traffic. Such
closures or limitations and restrictions were at times mandated the government, and at other times due to natural customer uncertainties
regarding the status of COVID-19. Such restrictions and uncertainties not only impacted anticipated revenues from current locations, but
added additional risk to us related to the opening of new locations. Thus, the uncertainty regarding the scope and longevity of such restrictions
modified our plans as to how quickly we could enact our expansion plans. 

More specifically, COVID-19 has challenged our performance at our kiosk
locations, though our cafe locations have improved in performance. Shopping mall restrictions and mandates during the pandemic made it
difficult for our kiosks to operate at maximum performance, as indoor restrictions of shopping malls affected the way we had to operate
business. For instance, we had to offer only to-go/pickup operations to operate while meeting regulations. We have learned how to move
forward aggressively despite such regulations and mandates, doing what we can to serve the coffee we are so proud to serve, whether this
means offering to-go orders only or working with delivery services. 

In May 2020, the Company availed itself of a loan under the Paycheck
Protection Program (PPP) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) in the amount of 115,000, and 500,000 under the
SBA s Economic Injury Disaster Loan assistance program, all of which is currently outstanding as of December 31, 2021, provided
however that repayment was deferred to commence in May 2022. In February 2021, the Company secured a second PPP loan under this program
in the amount of approximately 167,000. The Company was granted forgiveness for the initial PPP Loan prior to December 31, 2021 and expects
to be granted forgiveness on the remainder subsequently. 

21 

In January 2022 we announced a price increase of our whole roasted
beans by 15 on our website which we attribute to increases due to inflation in the cost of raw green coffee beans, the cost of shipping
and supplies, and nationwide increases in labor costs-- factors that may or may not be attributable to the pandemic and/or the governmental
policies and mandates that were implemented during and in the wake of COVID-19. As of the date hereof and in January 2022 at the time
of our price increase, inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations since we have been able to offset such increased
costs by increasing the price of our whole roasted beans by 15 in January 2022, through increased sales and growth in opening 2 new company-owned
retail locations, better lease terms on such new company-owned retail locations, more efficient purchasing practices (e.g., volume purchase
discounts), productivity improvements and greater economies of scale. Severe increases in inflation, however, could affect the global
and U.S. economies and could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

We do not expect COVID-19 to affect our future operating results significantly,
as we are confident that coffee is an essential product that people rely on and will always drink. We intend to meet all governmental
business operation regulations and improve sales by whatever means necessary, utilizing resources such as food delivery services and to-go/pickup
orders. However, the impact of COVID-19 continues to evolve, and we cannot easily predict the future potential impacts of the pandemic
on our business or operations or on the United States or global economy in general. This may include any recurrence of the disease, actions
taken in response to the evolving pandemic, any ongoing effects on consumer demand and spending patterns or other impacts of the pandemic.
Whether these or other currently unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our results of
operations, cash flows or financial condition is yet to be determined. For additional details regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our
business, see Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Pandemics or disease outbreaks such as the COVID-19 have had, and may
continue to have, an effect on our business and results of operations. 

Components of Our Results of Operations 

Revenue 

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards
Codification ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company s net revenue primarily consists of revenues
from its retail locations and wholesale and online store. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue as follows: 

Retail Store Revenue 

Retail store revenues are recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale.

Wholesale and online revenues are recognized when the products are delivered, and title passes to customers or to the wholesale distributors. When customers pick up products at the Company s warehouse, or distributed to the wholesale distributors, the title passes, and revenue is recognized. Wholesale revenues make up approximately 3 of the Company s total revenue. 

Royalties and Other Fees 

Franchise revenues consist of royalty fee and other franchise fees. Royalty fee is based on a percentage of franchisee s weekly gross sales revenue at 5 . The Company recognizes the fee as the underlying sales occur. The Company recorded revenue from royalty of 0 for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. Other fees are earned as incurred and the Company did not have any other fee revenue for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.

Revenues. Revenues were approximately 1.5 million for the six-month
period ended June 30, 2022, compared to 880,000 for the comparable period in 2021, representing an increase of 661,000, or 75.2 . Revenues
were approximately 788,000 million for the three-month period ended June 30, 2022, compared to 491,000 for the comparable period in
2021, representing an increase of 297,000, or 60.5 . The increase in sales for the periods was primarily driven by the opening of the
Corona Del Mar, Laguna Woods and Santa Anita locations during 2021, and to the continued focus on marketing efforts to grow brand recognition. 

Product, food and drink costs. Product, food and drink costs
were approximately 564,000 for the six-month period ended June 30, 2022 compared to 270,000 for the comparable period in 2021, representing
an increase of approximately 294,000, or 108.7 , and were approximately 279,000 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2022 compared
to 135,000 for the comparable period in the prior year, representing an increase of 144,000 of 105.9 . The increase in costs for the
periods was partially driven by the opening of new locations and the overall increase in sales for the period. As a percentage of revenues,
product, food and drink costs increased to 36.6 in the six-month period ended June 30, 2022 compared to 30.7 in the comparable period
in 2021 and increased to 35.4 in the three-month period ended June 30, 2022 compared to 27.6 in the comparable period in 2021. The increase
in costs as a percentage of sales was primarily driven by general inflationary pressures and the seasonal fluctuations in cost of ingredients.
We monitor these fluctuations in product costs to analyze whether they are considered to be representative of general economic conditions,
such as inflation, or to be related to commodity specific changes. For example, green bean suppliers raised pricing by 15 to 20 throughout
2021, higher than the overall rate of inflation, however it has been more stable recently and even decreasing slightly in the second quarter
of 2022. 

General and administrative expenses. General
and administrative expenses were approximately 2.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2022 compared to 1.2 million for
the comparable period in the prior year, representing an increase of approximately 1.2 million, or 101.2 , and were approximately 1.4
million for the three-month period ended June 30, 2022 compared to 656,000 for the comparable period in 2021, representing an increase
of approximately 775,000, or 118.3 . This increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the hiring of additional
administrative employees, increases in professional services and corporate-level costs to support growth plans, the opening of new restaurants,
as well as costs associated with outside administrative, legal and professional fees and other general corporate expenses associated with
preparing to become a public company. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses increased to 160.1 in the six-month
period ended June 30, 2022 from 139.4 in the comparable period of 2021, and increased to 181.7 for the three-month period ended June
30, 2022 from 133.6 in the comparable period in 2021, primarily due to the increased administrative expenditures for the reasons mentioned
above.

Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities during the
six-month period ended June 30, 2022 was 1.2 million, which resulted from net loss of 1.5 million, non-cash charges of 225,000 for
stock compensation and 98,000 for depreciation and net cash outflows of 43,000 from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The
net cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily the result of increases in inventory of 14,000 and
prepaid and other assets of 28,000 and a decrease in accounts payable of 46,000, partially offset by increase of 47,000 in accrued
liabilities. The increase in accrued liabilities was primarily due to the timing of cash payments for sales tax and payroll.

six-month period ended June 30, 2021 was 538,000, which resulted from net loss of 635,000, non-cash charges of 82,000 for depreciation,
and net cash outflows of 6,000 from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The net cash outflows from changes in operating assets
and liabilities were primarily the result of increases in inventories of 7,000 and prepaids and other assets of 65,000, partially offset
by increases of 50,000 in accounts payable and 17,000 in accrued liabilities. 

Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities during the six-month periods
ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 was 168,000 and 317,000, respectively, These expenditures in each period are primarily related to purchases
of property and equipment in connection with current and future location openings and maintaining our existing locations. 

Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities during the six-month period
ended June 30, 2022 was 613,000, primarily due to 595,000 of borrowings under a line of credit, and 150,000 of loans from shareholders.
This was partially offset by 131,000 of repayments of borrowings. 

Net cash provided by financing activities during the six-month period
ended June 30, 2021 was 867,000, primarily due to approximately 533,000 cash received through borrowings and 553,000 of proceeds from
issuance of common stock, offset by approximately 220,000 of repayments of borrowings. 

As of June 30, 2022, the Company had total assets of 4,593,013.
Our cash balance as of June 30, 2022 was approximately 150,000. From inception (of Reborn Global in November 2014) to June 30, 2022,
we have not had any positive operating cash flow. 

Credit Facilities

 0 and 122,000, respectively.

Economic Injury Disaster Loan 

On May 16, 2020, the Company executed the standard loan documents required
for securing a loan (the EIDL Loan from the SBA under its Economic Injury Disaster Loan EIDL assistance
program in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company s business. As of June 30, 2022, the loan payable, Emergency
Injury Disaster Loan noted above is not in default. 

Pursuant to that certain Loan Authorization and Agreement (the SBA
Loan Agreement ), the Company borrowed an aggregate principal amount of the EIDL Loan of 500,000, with proceeds to be used for
working capital purposes. Interest accrues at the rate of 3.75 per annum and will accrue only on funds actually advanced from the date
of each advance. Installment payments, including principal and interest, are due monthly beginning May 16, 2021 (twelve months from the
date of the SBA Loan) in the amount of 731. The balance of principal and interest is payable thirty years from the date of the SBA Loan.
In connection therewith, the Company also received a 10,000 grant, which does not have to be repaid. During the year ended December 31,
2020, 10,000 was recorded in Economy injury disaster loan (EIDL) grant income in the Statements of Operations. The schedule of payments
on this loan was later deferred to commence 24 months from the date of loan, and therefore, the full amount of the loan is outstanding
as of June 30, 2022 and payments shall commence starting in May 2022. 

In connection therewith, the Company executed (i) a loan for the benefit
of the SBA (the SBA Loan ), which contains customary events of default and (ii) a Security Agreement, granting the SBA a
security interest in all tangible and intangible personal property of the Company, which also contains customary events of default (the
 SBA Security Agreement ). 

Paycheck Protection Program Loan 

In May 2020, the Company secured a loan under the Paycheck Protection
Program administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the SBA in the amount of 115,000. In February 2021, the
Company secured a second loan under this program in the amount of approximately 167,000. The interest rate of the loan is 1.00 per
annum and accrues on the unpaid principal balance computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. Commencing
seven months after the effective date of each PPP Loan, the Company is required to pay the Lender equal monthly payments of principal
and interest as required to fully amortize any unforgiven principal balance of the loan by the two-year anniversary of the effective
date of the loan. The PPP Loan contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults, making materially
false or misleading representations to the SBA or the Lender, or breaching the terms of the PPP Loan. The occurrence of an event of default
may result in the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the PPP Loan, collection of all amounts owing from the Company, or filing
suit and obtaining judgment against the Company. Under the terms of the CARES Act, PPP loan recipients can apply for and be granted forgiveness
for all or a portion of the loan granted under the PPP. Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations, based on the use
of loan proceeds for payment of payroll costs and any payments of mortgage interest, rent, and utilities. Recent modifications to the
PPP by the U.S. Treasury and Congress have extended the time period for loan forgiveness beyond the original eight-week period, making
it possible for the Company to apply for forgiveness of its PPP loan. The Company was granted forgiveness for the initial PPP Loan prior
to December 31, 2021 and expects to be granted forgiveness on the remainder subsequently. 

Line of Credit Facility 

During the second quarter of 2022, the Company entered into a line
of credit agreement with a financial institution that provides a maximum borrowing limit of 2,000,000 with interest at 5 per annum.
This line of credit facility matures on December 31, 2022. Total balance as of June 30, 2022 was 594,529. 

Leases 

Operating Leases 

We currently lease all company-owned retail locations. Operating leases
typically contain escalating rentals over the lease term, as well as optional renewal periods. Rent expense for operating leases is recorded
on a straight-line basis over the lease term and begins when Reborn has the right to use the property. The difference between rent expense
and cash payment is recorded as deferred rent on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Pre-opening rent is included in selling,
general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Tenant incentives used to fund leasehold improvements
are recorded in deferred rent and amortized as reductions to rent expense over the term of the lease. 

26 

Income Taxes 

Reborn files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and California
state jurisdictions. 

Upon the closing of this offering, we will be taxed at the prevailing
U.S. corporate tax rates. We will be treated as a U.S. corporation and a regarded entity for U.S. federal, state and local income taxes.
Accordingly, a provision will be recorded for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations for U.S. federal,
state and foreign income taxes. 

JOBS Act Accounting Election 

We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the
JOBS Act, and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various public company reporting requirements for up to five years or until
we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company 
can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended
transition period under the JOBS Act. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public
companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that we are required
to disclose pursuant to these regulations. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into operating lease commitments, purchase commitments
and other contractual obligations. These transactions are recognized in our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements requires management to utilize
estimates and make judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management
believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimates are evaluated by management on an ongoing basis, and the results of these
evaluations form a basis for making decisions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Although actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, management believes that the
estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements are reasonable. The critical accounting policies affecting our financial
reporting are summarized in Note 2 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

We have determined that all other issued, but not yet effective accounting
pronouncements are inapplicable or insignificant to us and once adopted are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position. 

27 

Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by 17 C.F.R. 229 (10)(f)(i)
and are not required to provide information under this item. 

Item 4.
Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )),
as of June 30, 2022. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of June
30, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified by Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules and forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to
our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
any required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During the period ended June 30, 2022, our management
has evaluated the internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act. Based on
such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting
were ineffective as of June 30, 2022. Management of the Company believes that the ineffectiveness of internal controls was due to the
lack of accounting and financial team. 

28 

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

In the future, the Company may be subject to various legal
proceedings from time to time as part of its business. We are currently not involved in litigation that we believe will have a materially
adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. As of June 30, 2022, there is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry
or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self- regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge
of the executive officers of our company or any of our subsidiaries threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any
of our subsidiaries or of our company s or our company s subsidiaries officers or directors in their capacities as

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds. 

We have not made any
sales of unregistered equity securities during the quarterly period ended June 30, 2022. 

In August 2022, the Company
consummated its initial public offering (the IPO of 1,440,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of
 5.00 per share, generating gross proceeds of 7,200,000 pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-1 (as amended) (File No. 333-261937),
which was declared effective by the SEC on August 11, 2022. . EF Hutton, division of Benchmark Investments, LLC, acted as the representative
of the underwriters of the IPO. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us, we received
approximately 6.2 million in net proceeds from our initial public offering. 

There has been no material
change in the planned use of proceeds from our initial public offering as described in our final prospectus, dated August 11, 2022, which
was filed with the SEC on August 16, 2021 pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act. The primary use of the net proceeds from our
initial public offering continues to be, as follows: (i) approximately 8.0 million for the acquisition of property and the development
of a manufacturing plant to build, design and manufacture our new line of electric boats; (ii) approximately 2.0 million for ramp up
of production and inventory; (iii) approximately 2.6 million for working capital. 

No payments were made
by us to directors, officers or persons owning ten percent or more of our common stock or to their associates, or to our affiliates, other
than payments in the ordinary course of business to officers for salaries. Pending the uses described, we have invested the net proceeds
in our operating cash account.
