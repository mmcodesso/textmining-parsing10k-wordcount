SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and use terminology such as may, will, 
 expects, plans, anticipates, estimates, projects , potential, 
or continue, or the negative or other comparable terminology regarding beliefs, plans, expectations, or intentions regarding
the future. These forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from
those discussed and anticipated in such statements. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements relating to our
business strategy, which is based upon our interpretation and analysis of trends in the healthcare treatment industry, especially those
related to the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, and upon management s ability to successfully develop and commercialize
its principal product, the CTLM . This strategy assumes that the CTLM will provide benefits, from both a medical and an economic
perspective, to current alternative techniques for diagnosing and managing breast cancer. Factors that could cause actual results to materially
differ include, without limitation, the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic/economic crisis, the timely and successful completion of our
clinical trials required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA and compliance with the regulations of the FDA and
the China Food and Drug Administration CFDA the timely and successful submission of our FDA application for pre-market
approval and our ability to obtain U.S. marketing clearance; manufacturing risks relating to the CTLM , including our reliance on
a single or limited source or sources of supply for some key components of our products as well as the need to comply with especially
high standards for those components and in the manufacture of optical imaging products in general; uncertainties inherent in the development
of new products and the enhancement of our existing CTLM product, including technical and regulatory risks, cost overruns and delays;
our ability to accurately predict the demand for our CTLM product as well as future products and to develop strategies to address
our markets successfully; the early stage of market development for medical optical imaging products and our ability to gain market acceptance
of our CTLM product by the medical community; our ability to expand our international distributor network for both the near and longer-term
to effectively implement our globalization strategy; our dependence on senior management and key personnel and our ability to attract
and retain additional qualified personnel; risks relating to financing through private placements or other working capital financing arrangements;
technical innovations that could render the CTLM or other products marketed or under development by us obsolete; competition; risks
and uncertainties relating to intellectual property, including claims of infringement and patent litigation; risks relating to future
acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances; and reimbursement policies for the use of our CTLM product and any products
we may introduce in the future. There are also many known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, but not limited
to, technological changes and competition from new diagnostic equipment and techniques, changes in general economic conditions, healthcare
reform initiatives, legal claims, regulatory changes and risk factors detailed from time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission
filings that may cause these assumptions to prove incorrect and may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially
different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks and
uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described above or elsewhere in this report. All forward-looking statements and risk
factors included in this document are made as of the date of this Form 10-K Annual Report based on information available to us as of the
date of this report, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or risk factors. The occurrence of any of the
events described as risk factors or other future events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial position. Since our common stock is considered a penny stock, we are ineligible to rely on the safe harbor for
forward-looking statements provided in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section
21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). You are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on these forward-looking statements.

PART I 

Item 1. Business 

GENERAL BUSINESS OVERVIEW 

Our business address is 618 E South St, Suite
500, Orlando, FL 32801. Our Internet website address is www.imds.com . The information contained in, or that can
be accessed through, our website is not part of this Form 10-K annual report. 

Imaging Diagnostic Systems, Inc. IDSI or the Company is a late development stage medical technology company that has developed a new, non-invasive CT scanner CTLM that
uses a laser beam in place of ionizing X-ray for breast imaging. This technology is called Diffuse Optical Tomography. The CTLM will
provide an adjunctive imaging modality to other methods of imaging the breast such as X-ray mammography, MRI and ultrasound. 

Since inception in December 1993 as a Florida
corporation and subsequently its reverse merger with Alkan Corp., a New Jersey Corporation on April 14, 1994, we continued operations
and changed our state of incorporation from New Jersey to Florida, effective July 1, 1995. On July 14, 1995, we filed with the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC a Form 10 SB for registration of our securities as a small business issuer.
The Form 10 SB was declared effective in September 1995 and our stock began trading on the OTC Bulletin Board (OTC:BB) on September 20,
1995 under the symbol IMDS. We became a fully reporting company under Commission File Number 0-26028 and traded on the OTC:BB and then
on the OTC:QB and ultimately on the OTC PINK until September 25, 2014, at which time our registration was revoked by the SEC for failure
to timely file our required periodic reports. Our latest quarterly report on Form 10-Q that was filed prior to our filing of our Form
10 registration statement on August 28, 2018, was filed on May 15, 2013, for the quarter ended March 31, 2013. Our latest annual report
on Form 10-K that was filed prior to the filing of our Form 10 registration statement on August 28, 2018, was filed on October 15, 2012,
for the year ended June 30, 2012. Copies of our SEC reports through the date of revocation (the Prior Reports are available
at www.sec.gov. 

On August 28, 2018, we filed a Form 10 registration
statement to register issued and outstanding shares held by our shareholders and to become a fully reporting company under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). The Form 10 was amended in response to SEC comments on October 5, 2018 and November
14, 2018. On February 7, 2019, the SEC confirmed that it had no further comments on the Form 10. Under the Exchange Act, our registration
became effective on October 29, 2018, i.e. 60 days after filing the Form 10. The Form 10 was further amended on September 26, 2019 to
correct the classification of the Series L Convertible Preferred Stock from a current liability to temporary equity. 

As of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K
for the year ended June 30, 2022, we have had no substantial revenues from our operations and have incurred net losses applicable to common
shareholders since inception through June 30, 2022 of 135,482,996 after discounts and dividends on preferred stock. We incurred net losses
applicable to common shareholders of 665,329 for the year ended June 30, 2022 and 707,918 for the year ended June 30, 2021. 

The Company received marking clearance for the
CTLM from the Chinese FDA CFDA effective November 16, 2018 to November 15, 2023 as disclosed in the Company s
8-K report filed December 11, 2018; however, we anticipate that substantial losses from operations will continue until we begin to generate
revenues through the sales of CTLM systems in China. We believe that we face substantial delays before receiving marketing clearance
through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA ). These losses will be primarily due to an anticipated increase in marketing,
manufacturing and operational expenses associated with the international commercialization of the CTLM , expenses associated with
international commercialization of the CTLM , expenses associated with FDA approval processes, and the costs associated with advanced
product development activities. We have implemented a new business strategy which includes a licensing agreement on June 20, 2017 with
Xi an IDI Laser Imaging Co. Ltd (Xi an IDI), a related party, to shift manufacturing of the CTLM for the China and Asian
markets to China. 

The Company s next regulatory focus, after having obtained CFDA
approval in China, is on obtaining marketing clearance of its CTLM Breast Imaging System through the FDA. The premarket approval PMA process for U.S. marketing clearance is expected to take longer than the Chinese process, and we intend to resume
this effort after successful marketing and sales of CTLM systems in China. Our sales and marketing efforts in China have been significantly
hindered by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore we do not expect revenue from China in the foreseeable future. No sales in other
countries are expected in the near future, as we do not intend to pursue sales in other countries until after obtaining FDA marketing
clearance. 

1 

In analyzing the regulatory path forward, timeline, and costs associated
with the level of effort required to upgrade the Company s Quality Management System (QMS), we have decided not to renew our CE
mark (required for sales in the European Union) for this year and to consider reapplying in 2 to 3 years to avoid these regulatory fees.
Similarly, we will maintain our Quality Management System to be compliant to ISO 13485:2016 but not certify to ISO 13485:2016 by
Underwriters Laboratories (UL) which will allow us to avoid fees associated with certification, travel, and hosting audits. Maintaining
our QMS to be ISO 13485:2016 compliant will allow us to quickly schedule an audit with UL and become ISO 13485 certified when necessary. 

On October 23, 2019, we entered into a consulting agreement effective
as of November 1, 2019, with Dr. Huabei Jiang to serve as IDSI s Chief Scientific Consultant (the Consulting Agreement ).
Pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, Dr. Jiang is focused on improving the technical performance and image quality of IDSI s Computed
Tomography Laser Mammography (CTLM breast imaging device. The details of this Agreement were disclosed on our Form 8-K report filed
with the SEC on October 29, 2019. As of the date of this report, Dr. Jiang has completed the first phase of image quality improvement
and is currently collecting image data for evaluation and further technical improvement. 

Xi an IDI has been working with Yiling Hospital Management Group
based in Beijing, China Yiling to evaluate CTLM s potential use and application. As of the date of this report,
Xi an IDI has loaned three CTLM systems to Yiling and Yiling is at the stage of testing and data validation. 

It is important that the effectiveness of the image quality improvements
be established before Xi an IDI can resume their sales and marketing efforts in China. Once IDSI has substantial revenues and cash
flow, we believe we will be able to raise from operations and/or private investors the necessary funding to allow us to move forward with
our CTLM 3.0 project, as discussed in detail in the CTLM section below. The CTLM 3.0 project and some regulatory
initiatives have been put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences. 

SALE OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES RESULTING IN
A CHANGE OF CONTROL 

IDSI s financial condition steadily deteriorated
following the 2008 financial crisis and during the subsequent recession and weak economic recovery and by 2013 we found it impossible
to raise the capital needed to continue operations, so our focus turned to finding an acquirer with the substantial financial resources
and technical understanding required to complete the regulatory approval processes and bring the CTLM to market domestically and
internationally. Given our dire financial condition, we were fortunate to be introduced in February 2014 to Viable International Investments
LLC Viable ), a subsidiary of Sanya Wanbo (Viable) Investments, Ltd. Co Viable China ), registered in Sanya,
Hainan, China. Viable China had been approved by the Ministry of Commerce of the People s Republic of China (Certificate # 4600201400025)
to invest in senior housing projects, medical equipment projects, etc. in the U.S. 

On August 4, 2014, pursuant to a Securities Purchase
Agreement (the SPA dated as of June 27, 2014, among IDSI, Viable and certain affiliates of IDSI, Viable agreed to purchase
600 shares of the Company s Series M convertible preferred stock (the Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price
of 6,000,000 10,000 per share) of which 100,000 was paid pursuant to a non-refundable deposit on June 27, 2014. The first closing
as to 250 shares of Preferred Stock 2,500,000) occurred on August 4, 2014. 

Pursuant to the SPA, Viable agreed to purchase
an additional 350 shares of Preferred Stock in tranches of 200 shares 2,000,000) on July 31, 2015, and 150 shares 1,500,000) within
14 days after IDSI s receipt of FDA marketing clearance. Based on the conversion price of the Preferred Stock, purchase of all of
the Preferred Stock would provide Viable with beneficial ownership of 90 of our common stock based on the number of shares outstanding
as of the date of the SPA. IDSI and Viable agreed to modify the timing of the second and third tranches of Viable s investments
so that the purchase of 200 shares of Preferred Stock 2,000,000) closed on August 31, 2015, and the purchase of 150 shares of Preferred
Stock 1,500,000) closed on April 22, 2016, as Viable waived the condition of FDA marketing clearance. 

Since 2016, we have financed our operations through
loans by Viable and its affiliates and the private placement of common stock to Viable affiliates and independent Chinese investors. We
do not have any formal financing arrangements with Viable and its affiliates; however, Viable has stated its intention to continue to
provide financing of our operations consistent with past practice. While we believe that Viable and its affiliates will provide on commercially
reasonable terms the funding we need until we achieve a positive cash flow from operations. There can be no assurance that we will receive
such funding or that we will ever achieve profitability. If Viable fails to provide the anticipated funding, we would be materially adversely
affected and may have to cease operations due to a lack of funding.

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW 

Since inception, we have been engaged in the development
and testing of a laser breast imaging system that uses computed tomography and laser techniques designed to detect breast abnormalities.
Our CTLM has been initially commercialized on a limited basis in certain international markets where regulatory approvals have been
obtained; however, it is not yet approved for sale in the U.S. market. The CTLM system must obtain marketing clearance through the
FDA before commercialization can begin in the U.S. market. 

We have sold 26 CTLM systems since inception.
Since the Viable Acquisition in August 2014, we have ceased our international marketing effort and have focused on upgrading the CTLM 
with the latest technology and obtaining marketing clearance in the U.S. and China. CTLM version 2.0 was completed in 2016, and we
are developing a CTLM 3.0 prototype. The CTLM 3.0 project has been currently put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its
consequences. 

The Company received CTLM CFDA approval effective
November 16, 2018 to November 15, 2023 as disclosed in the Company s 8-K report filed on December 11, 2018. However, there can be
no assurance that we will obtain FDA marketing or other new international marketing clearances, that the CTLM will achieve market
acceptance or that sufficient revenues will be generated from sales of the CTLM to allow us to operate profitably. 

Sales in China or in other countries are expected in the foreseeable
future. The Company s next regulatory focus, after having obtained CFDA approval in China, is on obtaining U.S. marketing clearance
of its CTLM Breast Imaging System through the FDA. The PMA process for U.S. marketing clearance is expected to take considerably
longer than the Chinese process. 

Our financial statements have been prepared assuming
that we will continue as a going concern. Our auditors, in their report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 stated that we have incurred
recurring operating losses and will have to obtain additional capital to sustain operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2 Going
Concern and Management s Plans , in the Notes to the Financial Statements. The accompanying financial statements for the Fiscal
Year ended June 30, 2022 do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible effects on the recoverability and classification of assets
or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

BREAST CANCER 

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women
worldwide. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and World Health Organization (WHO). It is estimated that
more than 2 million new cases of breast cancer occurred among women worldwide in 2018, (using the most recent data available at time of
submission). Breast cancer incidence rates around the world vary a great deal. In general, developed countries (such as the U.S., England
and Australia) have higher rates than developing countries (such as Cambodia, Nepal and Rwanda). 

According to information provided by www.breastcancer.org ,
about one in eight U.S. women will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime. In 2021, an estimated 281,550 new cases
of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed in women in the U.S., along with 49,290 new cases of non-invasive (in situ) breast
cancer. About 43,600 women in the U.S. are expected to die in 2021 from breast cancer. Death rates have been decreasing in women over
50, but have been steady for women under 50 since 2007. These decreases are thought to be the result of treatment advances, earlier detection
through screening, and increased awareness. 

There is widespread agreement that screening for
breast cancer, when combined with appropriate follow-up, will reduce mortality from the disease. How we measure response to treatment
is called the 5-year survival rate, or the percentage of people who live 5 years after being diagnosed with cancer. According to information
provided by National Cancer Institute, Cancer stage at diagnosis, which refers to extent of a cancer in the body, determines treatment
options and has a strong influence on the length of survival. In general, if the cancer is found only in the part of the body where it
started it is localized (sometimes referred to as stage 1). If it has spread to a different part of the body, the stage
is regional or distant . The earlier female breast cancer is caught, the better chance a person has of surviving
five years after being diagnosed. For female breast cancer, 62.5 are diagnosed at the local stage. The 5-year survival for localized
female breast cancer is 98.8 . It decreases from 98.8 to 85.5 after the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes (stage 2), and to 27.4 
(stage 4) after it has spread to other organs such as the lung, liver or brain. A major problem with current detection methods is that
studies have shown that mammography does not detect 10 -20 of breast cancers that are detected by physical exam alone, which may be attributed
to a falsely negative mammogram. 

3 

Breast cancer screening is generally recommended
as a routine part of preventive healthcare for women over the age of 20 (approximately 90 million in the United States). Besides skin
cancer, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among U.S. women. For these women, the American Cancer Society (ACS) has published
guidelines for breast cancer screening including: (i) monthly breast self-examinations for all women over the age of 20; (ii) a clinical
breast exam (CBE) every three years for women in their 20s and 30s; (iii) a baseline mammogram for women by the age of 40; and (iv) an
annual mammogram for women age 40 or older (according to the American College of Radiology). Unfortunately, the U.S. Preventive Task Force
Guidelines have stirred confusion by recommending biennial screening mammography for women ages 50-74. 

Each year, approximately eight million women in
the United States require diagnostic testing for breast cancer due to a physical symptom, such as a palpable lesion, pain or nipple discharge,
discovered through self or physical examination (approximately seven million) or a non-palpable lesion detected by screening x-ray mammography
(approximately one million). Once a physician has identified a suspicious lesion in a woman s breast, the physician may recommend
further diagnostic procedures, including a diagnostic x-ray mammography, an ultrasound study, a magnetic resonance imaging procedure,
or a minimally invasive procedure such as fine needle aspiration or large core needle biopsy. In each case, the potential benefits of
additional diagnostic testing must be balanced against the costs, risks and discomfort to the patient associated with undergoing the additional
procedures. 

Breast cancer can be lumped into Non-invasive
(or in-situ) or Invasive: In-situ tissue types include ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in-situ (LCIS). 20 of breast
cancers are in-situ. 80 of breast cancers are invasive or infiltrating beyond their glandular or ductal origins. Breast cancers are subdivided
by molecular surface markers or hormonal receptor types that determines aggressiveness, and selection for therapeutic options. To be brief,
these subtypes are: 1. Luminal A (HR+/HER2-); 2. Triple Negative (HR-/HER2-); 3. Luminal B (HR+/HER2+); and 4. HER 2 Enriched (HR-/HER2+). 

The strongest risk factor for breast cancer is
a women s age. A woman s breast cancer risk increases with age. The risk of breast cancer, however, is not the same for all
women in a given age group. Research has shown that women with mammographically dense breasts have a higher risk of developing breast
cancer. Connective and glandular tissue of the breast are mammographically dense and appear white on a mammogram, compared to fatty tissue
of the breasts which appears dark or black because it is not mammographically dense. Women who have a high percentage of breast tissue
that appears dense on a mammogram have a higher risk of breast cancer compared to women of similar age who have a smaller percentage or
no dense breast tissue by as much as 1.5 X higher risk than the average woman. In general, younger women have dense breasts more often
than older women. As a woman ages, the amount of glandular tissue naturally decreases and the amount of fatty tissue increases. Abnormalities
- such as tumors in dense breasts - can be more difficult to detect on a mammogram because tumors often also appear white, which blends
with dense breast stroma. According to the National Cancer Institute and American College of Radiology, approximately 50 of women in
the U.S. are classified as having dense breasts (or BI-RADS type 3 or type 4 - defined as heterogeneously dense or extremely dense). 

Due in part to the limitations in the ability
of the currently available modalities to identify malignant lesions, a large number of patients with suspicious lesions proceed to surgical
biopsy, an invasive and expensive procedure. Approximately 1.6 million surgical biopsies are performed each year in the United States,
and about 20 of the tests find cancer. The average cost of a surgical biopsy ranges from approximately 1,000 5,000 per procedure.
Thus, biopsies of benign breast tissue may cost the U.S. healthcare system approximately 5.28 billion annually, using 3,303 per biopsy
which is what a patient s insurance company would pay according to HealthCareBlueBook.com. Fair Prices for a breast biopsy depend
on one s zip code in the U.S. and are rated based upon being a bedside, open, MRI-guided, Stereotactic-guided, or Ultrasound-guided
biopsy. In addition, biopsies result in pain, scarring, potential for infection and sometimes undue anxiety to patients. Patients who
are referred to biopsy usually are required to schedule the procedure in advance and generally must wait up to 72 hours for their biopsy
results.

Race and ethnicity play into the incidence and
the mortality from breast cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, incidence and death rates for breast cancer are higher among
non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks rather than other racial/ethnic groups. Asians and Pacific Islander women have the lowest
incidence and death rates from breast cancer. 

Since the CTLM has received CFDA marketing
clearance in China, we believe the CLTM will achieve significant market penetration in China. Consequently, it is important to discuss
the demographics of breast cancer in China. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in China, according to the latest data
from China s national cancer registry. An analysis of the data reveals that the incidence of breast cancer in China has increased
at a rate of around 3.5 a year from 2000 to 2013, compared with a drop of 0.4 a year over the same period in the US. The analysis also
reveals that breast cancer rates are higher in urban areas of China than in rural areas. And the higher the population density, the higher
the rate. For small cities (population below 500,000), the incidence of breast cancer is 30 per 100,000. For medium-sized cities (population
between 500,000 to 1,000,000), it is 40 in 100,000. And for large cities (population above 1m), the incidence rate is 60 per 100,000 women. 

There are many theories as to why China is seeing
a marked rise in breast cancer rates. These include: 

a. With the rapid development of China s
economy, more and more people have moved from rural areas and towns to large cities. As a result, many megacities have sprung
up. By 2014, China had six megacities with populations above 10m. It is very likely that urbanization is having a big impact on breast
cancer incidence in China. 

b. Having more than one child lowers
breast-cancer risk. With the one-child policy in place since 1979, most women especially if they worked in the city had
to strictly follow the policy in order to avoid being fined. Although the one-child policy rule was replaced in 2015 with a two-child
policy rule, the possible benefit on breast cancer incidence will probably take 15 to 20 years to show 

c. Women are also less likely to breastfeed
than previous generations, which may be another contributing factor. Research has shown that both pregnancy and breastfeeding reduce a
woman s risk of developing cancer, because they reduce the lifetime number of menstrual cycles. As a result, women are exposed to
less estrogen. (estrogen can stimulate breast cancer cells to grow.) It has also been hypothesized that breast cells need to mature in
order to produce milk and mature cells are more resistant to becoming cancer cells. 

d. In modern China, women are generally
less physically active than they were in previous generations. A study published in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition
and Physical Activity, shows that levels of physical activity for adults in China fell by nearly half between 1991 and 2011, and they
declined more rapidly for women than for men. 

e. Aging is the biggest risk factor
for breast cancer. Women are living longer in China, which is a key factor related to the increased incidence of breast cancer in the
country. As people get older, there is more genetic damage and less ability to repair the damage. 

With increasing incidence and mortality, cancer
is the leading cause of death in China and is a major public health problem. Because of China s massive population (1.37 billion),
previous national incidence and mortality estimates have been limited to small samples of the population using data from the 1990s or
based on a specific year. With high-quality data from an additional number of population-based registries now available through the National
Central Cancer Registry of China, the authors analyzed data from 72 local, population-based cancer registries (2009-2011), representing
6.5 of the population, to estimate the number of new cases and cancer deaths for 2015. Data from 22 registries were used for trend analyses
(2000-2011). The results indicated that an estimated 4,292,000 new cancer cases and 2,814,000 cancer deaths would occur in China in 2015,
with lung cancer being the most common incident cancer and the leading cause of cancer death. Exact details on breast cancer incidence
and rates can be found in the journals Thoracic Cancer 8; 2017, pages 214-218 and the Journal of Gynecological Oncology 2018, Jan; 29
(1). 

Because of China s large population, even
with a small percentage improvement on cancer prevention, a sizeable number of women s lives could be saved. There are many risk
factors that can be reduced by raising cancer awareness and having better education on diet, exercise, stress reduction as well as improving
breast cancer screening. Public health authorities in China can play a crucial role in developing well-defined strategies to tackle the
issue and reduce the breast cancer burden in China.

SCREENING AND DIAGNOSTIC MODALITIES 

Mammography is an x-ray imaging modality commonly
used for both routine breast cancer screening and as a diagnostic tool. A mammogram produces either film-screen (analog) or electronic
digital images of the internal structure of the breast, nipple, axilla and surrounding tissues. In a screening mammogram, physicians seek
to detect unknown or asymptomatic lesions, while a diagnostic mammogram seeks to characterize suspicious or palpable lesions. 

In the United States, a certified technologist
performs the x-ray procedure under the Congressional Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA). MQSA was enacted to improve x-ray breast
cancer detection studies by regulating machine specifications, quality control procedures, technologist training and certification, and
Radiologist training, certification, and triennial continuing medical education. Still, mammography is viewed as an imperfect 
breast cancer detection tool and is often supplemented with follow-up studies including additional mammographic views at later dates,
closer physical examination of the patient, adjunctive ultrasound exams, and, when available, breast MRI, scintimammography, and/or biopsy. 

Because x-ray mammography exposes the patient
to radiation, the American Cancer Society recommends that mammograms be limited to once per year. X-ray mammography is documented to be
less effective for women with dense breasts. X-ray mammography machines use mechanical means to squeeze, flatten, or compress the breast
and reduce the volume so that x-rays may penetrate more uniform tissue. These techniques are technically necessary but are sometimes painful
and often uncomfortable to patients. Most mammography exams include 2 views of each breast which equates to 4 compressions per session
or up to 8 compressions in women with bilateral breasts prostheses. For diagnostic purposes, some centers are using contrast-enhanced
mammography as a way to assess for tumors that take up iodinated contrast, increasing sensitivity. 

For an uninsured patient, the average U.S. cost
for a mammogram is 102. The Medicare billing of a diagnostic mammogram is approximately 118 to 138 per procedure and requires the use
of x-ray equipment ranging in cost from 75,000 to 225,000 for film screen. Aggregate cost of mammography screening in the U.S. is recently
estimated at 7.8 billion per year. 

Digital Mammography 

Digital mammography, also referred to as full-field
digital mammography, is the latest form of breast x-ray examination. These systems eliminate the use of x-ray film and record images
directly on electronic panels. The digital images can then be manipulated, examined on an electronic viewing station, and subjected to
computed added detection or CAD. However, the limitations of conventional mammography still exist in digital mammography. Digital mammograms
can be acquired as 2D or 3D, using breast tomosynthesis. Although 3D mammograms are better at detecting more abnormalities (especially
in denser breasted women), they do results in higher recall rates, twice the breast radiation dose, take longer for the Radiologist to
read, and cost the patient and system more money. The miss rate from using 3D mammograms has yet to be established. Many
U.S. insurance companies still will not cover a 3D digital mammogram. Digital mammography units sell at around 300,000 for 2D digital
units and up to 500,000 for 3D digital units and Medicare billing for these tests range from 170 to 200. 

Magnetic Resonance Imaging 

Magnetic resonance imaging MRI produces images using a magnetic field and radiofrequency (RF) gradients under computer control to produce multiplanar and multi-sequenced
images that are sensitive to detecting a variety of pathologic processes. MRI has proven effective in imaging breasts with prosthetic
implants, characterizing benign breast processes, detecting primary or recurrent cancer, evaluating the response to chemotherapy and serving
as an additional imaging option when mammography or ultrasound fails to provide sufficient diagnostic conclusions. 

MRI offers the advantage over x-ray that not only
visualizes fine details in breast tissue but also detects patterns of enhancement, altered blood flow and angiogenesis associated with
malignancies, by using a paramagnetic agent called gadolinium (which must be injected into the patient s veins and sometimes requires
screening for renal insufficiency). The disadvantages are that MRI systems are not widely available in the global market and the costs
of using conventional MRI scanners for breast exams are sometimes prohibitive. Dedicated breast MRI systems sell for approximately 1,200,000
and total billing is approximately 1,500, depending on whether the service is provided in a free-standing imaging center, hospital, and
is billed either self-pay, private insurance or Medicare. 

6 

Ultrasound 

Ultrasound imaging is routinely used in breast
imaging practices. Ultrasound (U/S) systems can image breast tissue by sonar techniques. Sound transducers are placed directly
on breast tissue coupled with an acoustic gel substance. Trained sonographers locate suspicious or targeted areas by moving the transducer
over the whole breast or over the region of interest. Breast ultrasound can be performed by a trained medical professional or it can also
be done in an automated fashion. Sonographers generally acquire images in the United States. In some countries mostly outside the U.S.,
physicians directly perform the study and interpret the results. Ultrasound images are localized to areas of suspicion generally but not
always detected by a previous mammogram. If mammographic results suggest the presence of a lesion, ultrasound may help differentiate a
solid from a cystic mass, determine vascularity, concurrent adenopathy, and locate a safe biopsy access site. The global Medicare reimbursement
rate for diagnostic bilateral breast ultrasound is approximately 164 per procedure and requires the use of capital equipment ranging
in cost from approximately 60,000 to 400,000 depending upon unit hardware configuration, software platforms, and transducer selections. 

Optoacoustic Imaging 

This patented technology uses a combination of
anatomic and functional imaging via the use of laser optics and conventional ultrasound. Optoacoustic imaging looks for tumor angiogenesis.
The main company in this field - Seno Medical Instruments Seno - uses proprietary laser techniques to locate oxyhemoglobin
and deoxyhemoglobin signatures in breast tumors and these patterns can help clinicians decide which tumors to target for biopsy. This
device, which is undergoing Pre-Market Approval and clinical pivotal studies, appears to be close to FDA approval. 

Single-Breath Photoacoustic Computed Tomography 

This new modality called BH-PACT, similar to CTLM 
discussed below, features a deep penetration depth (4 cm in vivo) with high spatial and temporal resolutions (255 m in-plane resolution
and a 10 Hz 2D frame rate). By scanning the entire breast within a single breath hold (~15 s), a volumetric image can be acquired and
subsequently reconstructed utilizing 3D back-projection with negligible breathing-induced motion artifacts. SBH-PACT clearly reveals tumors
by observing higher blood vessel densities associated with tumors at high spatial resolution, showing early promise for high sensitivity
in radiographically dense breasts. In addition to blood vessel imaging, the high imaging speed enables dynamic studies, such as photoacoustic
elastography, which identifies tumors by showing less compliance. The research group imaged breast cancer patients with breast sizes ranging
from B cup to DD cup, and skin pigmentations ranging from light to dark. SBH-PACT identified all the tumors without resorting to ionizing
radiation or exogenous contrast, posing no health risks. Diffuse optical tomography has been investigated to provide functional optical
contrast. However, the spatial resolution of the current prototypes limits their clinical use. Overall, each modality has notable advantages
and limitations. Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a promising complementary modality that overcomes many of these limitations. 

By developing this advanced breast imaging modality,
they provided a promising tool for future clinical use including not only screening, but also diagnostic studies to determine extent of
disease, to assist in surgical treatment planning, and to assess responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Compared to mammography, SBH-PACT
utilizes non-ionizing radiation, shows early promise for sensitivity in radiographically dense breasts, and imposes less or no pain by
only slightly compressing the breast against the chest wall. Because the average hemoglobin concentration in malignant tumors is generally
twice that in benign tumors and using hemoglobin as the contrast, SBH-PACT can potentially monitor breast cancer s response to neoadjuvant
chemotherapy by acquiring information similar to that of contrast-enhanced MRI, yet with finer spatial resolution, higher imaging speed,
and only endogenous contrast. This new modality is under development at Caltech Optical Imaging Laboratory at the California Institute
of Technology. 

Breast Elastography 

This sonographic technology is increasingly being
used to better characterize breast lesions, by improving specificity of B-mode ultrasound. Two elastography modes are available: free-hand
and sheer-wave. Tissues have different elastic moduli and deform relative to its intrinsic stiffness. Breast Ultrasound Elastography (BUE)
has an 87 sensitivity, 90 specificity, and 88 diagnostic accuracy in defining breast lesions as either malignant or benign. BUE is
intended to have a high negative predictive value by reducing false positives. There are many quantitative and qualitative scoring systems
to characterize lesions by using BUE. Such schemata have been incorporated into the newest ACR Ultrasound BIRADS Lexicon manual. By using
these methods to characterize breast lesions, BUE is reported to increase diagnostic confidence, reduce unnecessary short-term follow
up and unneeded biopsy of benign breast tumors. 

7 

Molecular Breast Imaging 

This technique of MBI uses a nuclear medicine
agent called 99mTc Sestamibi, which is injected into the bloodstream and tends to accumulate in cancer cells within the breast, based
on differences in metabolism. Then the breast is imaged on 1 or 2 detectors for up to 40 minutes total or 10 minutes per breast x 2 views.
MBI is a functional study and the injected agent emits gamma rays which are identified on a scintillation crystal. By using MBI, there
is added radiation dose to the patient equal to 2/3 of the background dose but at the added benefit of detecting 8 more cancers per 1000
women when compared to mammography alone. This is an alternative study in women who have dense breasts and cannot undergo MRI but should
not be used in pregnant women. 

Positron Emission Mammography 

Positron emission mammography is a combination
anatomic functional study of the breast utilizing a radiation emitting agent called FDG or 18-fluorodeoxyglucose or FDG-18 that is taken
up in cancer cells that are utilizing glucose as an energy source. This procedure requires the patient to fast for up to 6 hours, requires
40 minutes total of scan time and is used to determine recurrence of cancer from scar tissue, when women cannot undergo MRI, or response
to treatment. Because of the moderately high radiation dose, it is not used for screening but more for problem solving. 

CTLM 

The CTLM system is a Diffuse Optical Tomography
(DOT) CT-like scanner. Its energy source is a laser beam portion of the electromagnetic spectrum not ionizing radiation such as is used
in conventional x-ray mammography or CT scanners. We believe that the advantages of imaging without ionizing radiation are very significant.
CTLM is an emerging imaging modality offering the potential of functional imaging equivalent, which can visualize the process of
angiogenesis - that may be used by the radiologist or responsible physician to distinguish between benign and malignant tissue. X-ray
mammography is a well-established method of imaging the breast but has limitations especially in dense breast cases. While x-ray mammography
and ultrasound generally produce two dimensional images (2D) of the breast, the CTLM produces 3D images. Ultrasound is often used
as an adjunct to mammography to help differentiate tumors from cysts or help to localize a biopsy site. We believe the CTLM will
be used to provide the radiologist with additional information to manage the clinical case via angiogenesis detection; help diagnose breast
cancer earlier; reduce diagnostic uncertainty especially in mammographically dense breast cases; and may help decrease the number of biopsies
performed for benign lesions. Because breast cancers nearly always develop in the dense glandular tissue of the breast (and very rarely
in the fatty tissue), women who have mostly dense tissue on a mammogram are at an increased risk of breast cancer, via failed mammographic
detection. Abnormalities in dense breasts can be more difficult to detect on a mammogram. 

The CTLM technology is unique and protected
by a combination of trade secrets and patents. A CTLM breast exam is non-invasive and can be performed by a medical technologist.
A patient lies face down or prone on a scanning table with one breast suspended naturally into a specially designed scanning chamber.
The scanner images the breast in contiguous slices from chest wall to nipple in minutes. One breast is scanned at a time. The CTLM 
is a sophisticated electro-mechanical scanner under microprocessor and computer control. Results are available immediately in digital
format for comparison to mammography results, consultation, transmission to multimodality reading stations, or archiving. 

Images and study results present as multiple-slice
data sets which can be viewed slice-by-slice or as a 3D volume with image manipulation tools. Images are usually viewed in gray and green
color shades, since color displays are common with other molecular imaging modalities such as nuclear medicine, PET, fMRI, and in radiation
therapy imaging. 

Since the Viable Acquisition we have focused on
revitalizing the CTLM technology. We completed the upgrade of the CTLM to the CTLM 2.0 in late 2016. We took the following
principal steps in this upgrade: 

Collecting and archiving all the documents to build the gantry
and the cover of the scanner. 

Collecting and archiving all the documents to build the controllers
of the scanner. 

8 

Collecting and archiving all the software codes that are
necessary to maintain the scanner. 

Simulating industry standard architecture (ISA) bus using
a digital input/output (IO) card on a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus in order to be able to use modern computers without
modifying any controller of the scanner. 

Replacing two racks of obsolete and bulky power supplies
with a simple and small medical grade power supply. 

Replacing the operator console computer. 

Replacing the obsolete Windows 2000 operating system with
Windows 8. 

We continue to work to further advance the CTLM 
technology and the quality and efficiency of our systems. 

We believe it is critical to provide physicians
with a visualization tool that allows them to find angiogenesis from the CTLM images with minimal false positives as well as minimal
false negatives. Currently, IDSI includes as a CTLM operating component a software package known as Physician Console 
to enable physicians to read CTLM images. Limited signal to noise image ratios and a lack of quantitative data are among the drawbacks
of this visualization software package. 

We are developing and plan to release a new software
package known as CTLM Physician Workstation to replace the Physician Console and provide with each CTLM the capability
to identify, locate and measure an angiogenesis area. No date has been set for its release. 

The CTLM Physician Workstation possesses
the key features of the Physician Console and has many additional features not contained in the console, including: 

A volumetric approach to find angiogenesis using vascular
regions, MIP, ESSD and TSSD views. 

Image measurements to find the CTLM numbers of a pixel
in a CTLM image and the distance between two points of the breast using a CTLM image. 

Volume measurement of a high absorption area that could be
an angiogenesis area. 

Image correlation between CTLM images or between a CTLM 
image and another image from a different modality such as mammography. 

Commands to manipulate images which are context sensitive,
with most having shortcut keys. 

Reading DICOM images. 

Online help. 

New tools including image segmentation, object collection
and volume measurement to monitor neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Physicians will be able to quantify the volume of angiogenesis
area as a measure of potential tumor regression or non-response from chemotherapy. 

Since 2017, we began working on development of
our CTLM 3.0 scanner. This newly designed scanner will offer a very high throughput, with the scan time potentially being reduced
from 20 to 2 minutes for a 100-slice breast scan. We believe that this increased efficiency will be achieved with image quality at least
as good as that of the CTLM 2.0, with diminished stair-step artifact and improved signal to noise ratio. 

Further, we believe that the CTLM 3.0 will
be substantially easier and less expensive to manufacture, install and service, compared to the 2.0 version. 

The principal features of the CTLM 3.0 under
development are: 

New helical scanning mode. 

9 

New small footprint of the scanner. 

New gantry. 

Capability to move the scan chamber (in the X and Y axis)
to center the breast. 

Capability to collect data about 2mm closer to the chest
wall compared to the 2.0 version. 

New data acquisition system for faster scanning and improved
signal to noise ratio. 

New scan controls. 

Use of wireless technology in scanning operations and visualization. 

New database. 

New graphical user interface (GUI). 

New software package to scan, reconstruct and visualize. 

Compatibility with DICOM 3.0. 

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this project has
been delayed. Until there is adequate working capital from sales revenue or additional capital funding, this project has been put on hold. 

FLUORESCENCE IMAGING 

Fluorescence and molecular imaging techniques
are of growing importance to the drug development industry and for disease detection. Certain molecules exhibit the phenomenon of emitting
light after being illuminated by light of an appropriate wavelength, e.g., from a laser. The light that is emitted is referred to as fluorescent 
light. The compounds that produce fluorescence are commonly referred to as fluorescent dyes. At least one company to our knowledge is
developing a fluorescent compound for possible use in breast cancer detection. 

The CTLM system laser diodes can stimulate
fluorescent light emissions when used in conjunction with such compounds. When an appropriate fluorescent compound has been introduced
into the blood, areas with an abundance of blood vessels, i.e., the angiogenesis associated with a tumor, may retain a higher concentration
of the fluorescent compound. As the CTLM scanner illuminates these areas, fluorescent light is emitted and detected. Reconstructed
CTLM images then locate and quantify the fluorescent area within the area of interest. 

Several CTLM systems were retrofitted with
laser diodes tuned to specific wavelengths of light which matched the compounds. Optical filters limited the spectral responses to selected
wavelengths. Experiments were conducted by placing fluorescent compounds inside a breast equivalent phantom and scanning it with CTLM .
To our knowledge we were the first with the ability to excite a fluorescent compound, detect its location within the simulated breast,
and create an image. On September 14, 1999, a patent was issued to IDSI titled Laser Imaging Apparatus Using Biomedical Markers
that Bind to Cancer Cells as Patent No 5,952,664. This patent expired on January 16, 2018. 

In March 2002, we signed an agreement with Schering
AG to evaluate the advantages of new fluorescence compounds for the potential use of detecting breast cancer. We installed three CTLM 
systems for Schering AG s clinical trials: one at Charit s Robert-R ssle Clinic in Berlin, one at the University
of Muenster, and the third at Charit Hospital in Berlin, Germany as part of their Phase 1 clinical studies of fluorescent imaging
compounds. In November 2005, we announced that Schering AG had completed the evaluation of fluorescent imaging compound SF64 with three
modified CT Laser Mammography systems. 

In July 2009, we announced the commencement of
a breast cancer imaging study at the Charit , Medical University in Berlin, Germany. The study examined the potential role of the
CTLM as an enhanced breast cancer screening tool when used in combination with the fluorescent dye, Indocyanine Green (ICG). The
study was conducted at the Campus Virchow-Klinikum and the principal investigator was radiologist Dr. Alexander Poellinger. Pending further
investigation, technical refinement and funding, IDSI has postponed its efforts to research and develop fluorescence imaging techniques. 

10 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND APPROVALS 

United States Regulation 

The CTLM is a medical device and it is subject
to the relevant provisions of the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD C Act and its implementing regulations. Pursuant
to the FD C Act, the FDA regulates, among other things, the manufacturing, labeling, distribution, and promotion of the CTLM 
in the United States. The Act requires that a medical device must (unless exempted by regulation) be cleared or approved by the FDA before
being commercially distributed in the United States. The FD C Act also requires that manufacturers of medical devices, among other
things, comply with specific labeling requirements and manufacture devices in accordance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices, which
require that companies manufacture their products and maintain related documentation in a conformed manner with respect to manufacturing,
testing, and quality control activities. The FDA inspects medical device manufacturers and distributors, and has broad authority to order
recalls of medical devices, to seize non-complying medical devices, to enjoin and/or impose civil penalties, and to criminally prosecute
violators. 

The FDA classifies medical devices intended for
human use into three classes: Class I; Class II; and Class III. The CTLM is a Class III device. A PMA is the FDA process of scientific
and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices. Class III devices are those that support
or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potentially unreasonable
risk of illness or injury. Due to the level of risk associated with Class III devices, the FDA has determined that general and special
controls alone are insufficient to assure the safety and effectiveness of Class III devices. Therefore, these devices require a PMA application
in order to obtain marketing clearance. 

The FDA automatically classifies new technologies in Class III when
limited safety information is available and no predicate device is available. It allows for multiple clinical studies to be pursued to
gather the necessary data to obtain safety and clinical information to be used for future FDA submissions. At the time that we were developing
the CTLM system and considering our options for obtaining marketing clearance there was not enough data on laser-based technologies
nor were there approved other new medical devices dedicated to breast imaging other than the traditional x-ray technology. As a result,
the FDA in an August 2011 letter recommended that we seek a PMA application, and we decided to proceed accordingly. After receipt of the
PMA, IDSI can apply to have the risk reduced to the Class II risk classification where other diagnostic devices are classified. 

Progress toward submitting a PMA application during
2012-13 was significantly delayed and then eventually halted due to lack of funding, which required us to lay off key employees and terminate
our clinical activities and prevented us from hiring the necessary FDA consultants required to assist in the process. 

Following the Viable Acquisition, our new management
conducted a detailed analysis of our pre-acquisition FDA approval process and formulated a new plan for obtaining the approval, backed
by Viable s commitment to provide the necessary funding. We hired a new specialized regulatory consulting firm and legal counsel
with expertise in the FDA Approval process. We determined that, unfortunately, our pre-acquisition clinical data could not be used due
to non-conformance with FDA requirements. Consequently, we decided to conduct new clinical studies in order to collect the patient data
required for our new PMA application. In December 2015, we and our consultants met with the FDA examiners responsible for our approval
process, and we presented our proposed approach for data collection, patient selection and data analysis. After receiving the FDA examiners 
input (critiques and suggestions), we began working on a revised PMA protocol and also re-evaluating our PMA strategy. 

After our December 2015 informational meeting
with the FDA, we drafted a revised clinical investigation plan CIP for purposes of the PMA process; however, we have not
yet submitted the CIP to the FDA as we have been focusing since 2016 on our initial goal of obtaining CFDA marketing clearance and launching
operations in China. We are awaiting more clinical data from China in order to formulate our PMA pathway and strategy. All of the data
and trials we have assembled and conducted to date are for internal evaluation purposes and not for submission to the FDA. Once we have
developed a clear PMA strategy in conjunction with our FDA consultants, all of our clinical trials going forward will be designed to meet
the FDA s requirements for the PMA process. 

11 

Based on our current CIP, the intended use of
the CTLM is an adjunct to mammography for breast cancer screening in asymptomatic women who have dense (heterogeneously or extremely)
breasts per ACR categories. We may also pursue application of our technology in the neoadjuvant therapy areas. We will rely on our FDA
consultants to determine estimated costs and milestones for the PMA process which will resume when we have adequate funding from operations
and/or from Viable and its affiliates; however, there can be no assurance that we will secure this funding. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to timely submit our PMA application or that, if submitted, we will ultimately receive approval of the application
by the FDA. If we are unable to timely obtain marketing clearance for the CTLM in the United States, our business and financial condition
could be materially adversely affected. 

We will be able to submit our PMA application
only after successful completion and analysis of the relevant clinical trials, the plans for which have yet to be determined. 

Submission of a PMA application is followed by
a four-step review process consisting of: 

Administrative and limited scientific review by FDA staff
to determine completeness (acceptance and filing reviews); 

In-depth scientific, regulatory, and quality system review
by appropriate FDA personnel (substantive review); 

Review and recommendation by the appropriate advisory committee
(panel review); and 

Final deliberations, documentation and notification of the
FDA decision. 

FDA regulations provide 180 days to review a PMA
application and make a determination. In reality, the review time is normally longer. Before approving or denying a PMA application, the
appropriate FDA advisory committee may review the application at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee s recommendation
on whether the FDA should approve the submission. After the FDA notifies the applicant that the application has been approved or denied,
a notice is published on the Internet (1) announcing the data on which the decision is based, and (2) providing interested persons an
opportunity to petition the FDA within 30 days for reconsideration of the decision. 

The third-party manufacturers upon which we will
depend to manufacture our products are required to adhere to applicable FDA regulations regarding quality systems regulations commonly
referred to as QSRs, which include testing, control and documentation requirements. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements,
including marketing and promoting products for unapproved use, could result in warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall
or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant pre-market clearance or approval
for devices, withdrawal of approvals and criminal prosecution. Changes in existing regulations or adoption of new government regulations
or policies could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products. Material changes to medical devices also are subject to FDA review
and clearance or approval. 

Any products manufactured or distributed by us
pursuant to FDA marketing clearance will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA. Labeling, advertising and promotional
activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain instances, by the Federal Trade Commission. In addition, the marketing and
use of our products may be regulated by various state agencies. The export of medical devices is also subject to regulation in certain
instances. Both the FDA and the individual states may inspect the manufacturers of our products on a routine basis for compliance with
current QSR regulations and other requirements. 

In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to
numerous federal, state, and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection,
and fire hazard control. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and
regulations and that such compliance will not have a material adverse effect upon our ability to conduct business. See Item 7. Management s

International Regulatory Overview 

IDSI has upgraded its quality system for manufacturing
from ISO 13485:2003 to ISO 13485:2016 in June 2018 by successfully passing our certification audit conducted by Underwriters Laboratory UL ). We have not renewed our ISO 13485:2016 certificate to avoid the fees associated with this registration until we are
ready to manufacture. 

12 

Europe 

Based on our initial UL certification, in 2001
we obtained the CE Mark, which is required for us to sell the CTLM in the European Union EU ). The CE Mark expired
in July 2021, and we have not renewed it to avoid substantial regulatory fees. We will maintain our Quality Management System in accordance
with ISO 13485:2016 which will allow us to achieve ISO registration quickly to aid in our pursuit of FDA marketing clearance
and the CE Mark in the future. 

China 

We received CTLM CFDA approval effective
November 16, 2018 to November 15, 2023 as disclosed in our Form 8-K report filed on December 11, 2018. 

Australia,
Brazil, Canada, Japan and the United States 

IDSI is currently upgrading its QMS to meet the
requirements of the Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) in 2019 which will satisfy the audit and QMS requirements for these countries.
This sets the stage for IDSI to register the CTLM in each of these countries so that it can eventually be marketed, subject to satisfaction
of other relevant regulations in each country. 

DOMESTIC SALES AND MARKETING 

The CTLM will be positioned as an adjunct
to x-ray mammography and may be especially useful in studies of dense breasts. Consequently, CTLM will be marketed to centers performing
x-ray mammography. There are approximately 8,600 Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) centers certified in the United States. Marketing
and sales in the U.S. cannot occur unless and until we receive pre-market approval from the FDA. IDSI will begin marketing to the centers
following FDA approval. 

Since Diffuse Optical Tomography for laser breast
imaging is a new imaging modality the rate at which the CTLM achieves market acceptance and penetration will depend on many variables.
These include, but are not limited to, the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the clinical safety, efficacy,
and cost-effectiveness of the CTLM , and the advantage of the CTLM when used as an adjunct to existing technology and cancer
detection methods. 

The medical community and U.S. government have
recognized the need to address health concerns for women with dense breasts. As per https://densebreast-info.org/ 38 states and the District
of Columbia have enacted mandatory breast density legislation. These laws require physicians to inform women who have undergone mammography
regarding and about their breast density or about dense breast in general. Why the worry? Because 

1. BREAST DENSITY CAN OBSCURE CANCERS . Breast density
increases the likelihood that cancer will be missed by mammography; as breast density increases, mammographic sensitivity decreases. 

2. BREAST DENSITY IS AN INDEPENDENT RISK FACTOR FOR THE DEVELOPMENT
OF BREAST CANCER. Women with the densest breasts are 4 to 6-fold more likely to develop breast cancer than women with the least dense
breasts. 

3. IDENTIFY THE HIGH-RISK PATIENT WHO NEEDS INCREASED SURVEILLANCE.
Annual supplemental MRI screening is recommended in high-risk women beginning at age 25. 

4. UNDERSTAND SCREENING OPTIONS FOR WOMEN WITH DENSE BREASTS.
If a woman has dense breasts, should she consider supplemental screening beyond mammography alone? 

5. THERE ARE RISKS OF FALSE POSITIVES WITH ANY SCREENING STRATEGY.
Tomosynthesis (3D mammography) can reduce false positives and improve cancer detection, but is it available for your patients, and is
it warranted? 

If the classification of dense breasts is made
for a patient, then she may want to discuss other screening options shown by guiding flow charts. These laws were put in place to help
women get the necessary information to decide on further action if they were notified that they have dense breast tissue. In conjunction
with these laws, the 114th U.S. Congress has introduced a National Standard for Density Reporting. According to the American College of
Radiology approximately 50 of women are considered to have dense breasts. Failure of our products to gain market acceptance would have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There can be no assurance that physicians or
the medical community in general will accept and/or utilize the CTLM . 

13 

In order to effectively market any products, we
may develop, we will have to develop a marketing and distribution channel with technical expertise and distribution capability. There
can be no assurance that we will be able to establish sales and distribution capabilities or that we will be successful in gaining market
acceptance for the CTLM or any other products we may develop. 

INTERNATIONAL SALES AND MARKETING 

The only regulatory clearance we have now is CFDA
marketing clearance in China, and we rely on our affiliate Xi an IDI for all sales and marketing efforts in China. If and when we
renew our CE Mark and obtain regulatory marketing clearances in other foreign countries, we plan to rely on strategic relationships with
key international distributors for sales and service of the CTLM . Financial and logistical considerations make a direct sales model
unfeasible. Costs associated with maintaining direct relationships with specific contacts and customers, hiring appropriately trained
sales, marketing and service personnel or ensuring compliance with local product registration requirements all lead us to utilize a distributor
sales model. 

Sales of CTLM systems outside of the United
States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. The time required to obtain approval for
sale in foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ.
The laws of certain European and Asian countries permit us to market the CTLM in those countries before marketing would be permitted
in the United States. As a result, we sold 26 CTLM systems before the Viable Acquisition. In order to export the CTLM to other
countries we must obtain and maintain the FDA Certificate of Exportability for the CTLM . This certificate is required for the export
of Class III medical devices which have not received U.S. marketing clearance. The Certificate of Exportability must be renewed every
two years. IDSI s current certificate expired on August 20, 2020, and has not been renewed. 

Prior to the Viable Acquisition, IDSI had obtained
China marketing clearance through SFDA approval no. 20043241646 in August 2004. This approval expired in August 2008. We obtained a second
SFDA approval no. 20093242463 in October 2009. These approvals allowed limited government reimbursement for the CTLM . Four CTLM 
systems were sold to China Far East International Trading Corp. in 2004, and in 2007 a CTLM was placed at Tianjin Cancer Hospital
where a clinical study was conducted by Jin Qi, MD, who wrote a clinical paper at the conclusion of her study. The paper was published
in the March-April 2013 issue of Clinical Imaging which can be found at www.clinicalimaging.org . We were forced to terminate
our marketing efforts in China due to the loss of SFDA certification when SFDA changed from SFDA to CFDA in March 2013. Due to our lack
of financial resources, IDSI was not able to pursue CFDA approval until after the Viable Acquisition. 

Since the Viable Acquisition, we have decided
to refocus on the Chinese market as it is by far the largest international market for the CTLM , our management and Viable are very
familiar with that market, and China s more efficient regulatory procedures provide the opportunity to obtain marketing clearance
well before U.S. marketing clearance is likely to be obtained. 

In June 2017, we entered into a Technology Licensing
Agreement (the Xi an Agreement with Xi an IDI Laser Image Co. Ltd. Xi an IDI ), of Xi an,
Shaanxi Province, China. Xi an IDI is an affiliate of Viable. Pursuant to the Xi an Agreement, Xi an IDI has the exclusive
right to manufacture the CTLM in China and sell the CTLM in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Xi an IDI must pay to
IDSI on a quarterly basis a royalty of 25 of the gross revenues from the sale of the CTLM and related parts and accessories. We
expect to sell the CTLM in China for a price of approximately 250,000. 

The Company received CTLM CFDA approval effective
November 16, 2018 to November 15, 2023 as disclosed in the Company s 8-K filing on December 11, 2018. However, there can be no assurance
that we will obtain FDA marketing or other new international marketing clearances, that the CTLM will achieve market acceptance or
that sufficient revenues will be generated from sales of the CTLM to allow us to operate profitably. 

We have previously obtained the CE Mark and were
permitted to sell the CTLM in the 28 countries that are members of the European Union (EU); however, our lack of FDA marketing clearance
is a practical impediment to our marketing the CTLM in the EU and certain other countries as un-approved U.S. medical devices are
perceived as inferior in those countries. In analyzing the regulatory path forward, timeline, and costs associated with the level of effort
required to upgrade the Company s Quality Management System, we have decided not to renew our CE mark (required for sales in the
European Union) for this year and to consider reapplying in 2 to 3 years to avoid substantial regulatory fees. We will maintain our ISO
13485:2016 certification which will allow us to pursue U.S. marketing clearance and the CE Mark in the future. We intend to defer marketing
efforts in the EU until we believe we are close to receiving U.S. marketing clearance. 

14 

We will be subject to the substantial risks associated
with international sales, including economic and political instability, shipping delays, fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates,
foreign regulatory requirements and various tariffs and trade restrictions, all of which could have a significant impact on our ability
to deliver products on a timely basis. Future imposition of, or significant increases in the level of tariffs, export quotas or other
trade restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The regulation
of medical devices continues to develop and there can be no assurance that new laws or regulations will not have an adverse effect on
us. 

THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT; HEALTH CARE REFORM 

In the United States, suppliers of health care
products and services are greatly affected by Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act ACA or the Act ),
as well as by private insurance reimbursement programs. Third-party payers (Medicare, Medicaid, private health insurance companies and
other organizations) may affect the pricing or relative attractiveness of our products by regulating the level of reimbursement provided
by such payers to the physicians and clinics utilizing the CTLM or by refusing reimbursement. There can be no assurance that third-party
payers will provide reimbursement for use of our products. In international markets, reimbursement by private third-party medical insurance
providers, including governmental insurers and independent providers, varies from country to country. In certain countries, our ability
to achieve significant market penetration may depend upon the availability of third-party governmental reimbursement. 

The U.S. President and Congress have enacted a
comprehensive reform of the U.S. healthcare system through the passage of the ACA, most of whose provisions took effect in 2013-14. The
ultimate effect of this new Act to reform health care is uncertain, and there can be no assurance that the changes made to the U.S. healthcare
system will not materially adversely affect us. Some of the provisions in the Act may limit and further reduce and control spending on
healthcare products and services, limit coverage for new technology and limit or control the price health care providers and drug and
device manufacturers may charge for their services and products, respectively. These reforms could cause U.S. healthcare providers to
limit use of or not use the CTLM systems, in which case we would be materially adversely affected. 

PRODUCT LIABILITY 

Our business exposes us to potential product liability
risks, which are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of cancer detection products. While the CTLM is being developed
as an adjunct to other diagnostic techniques, there can be no assurance that we will not be subjected to substantial claims and potential
liability. Before the Viable Acquisition we carried 3,000,000 in product liability insurance to cover both clinical sites and sales.
As part of our cost savings initiatives, we cancelled the policy as we had not had any adverse experiences after conducting more than
25,000 patient scans worldwide; however, if an end user such as a hospital or imaging center requires us to provide specific product liability
insurance, we intend to ensure that our insurance meets any reasonable requirements. 

COMPETITION 

The medical device industry generally, and the
diagnostic imaging segments in particular, are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. The IDSI approach
of employing continuous wave laser optical technology in a CT-like device to produce 3D images for breast cancer detection is unique,
and the concept of imaging angiogenesis in the breast to differentiate between benign and malignant tissue is well accepted. 

Although the CTLM system is a CT-like scanner,
its energy source for imaging is a laser beam and not ionizing radiation such as is found in conventional x-ray mammography or CT scanners.
The advantage of imaging without ionizing radiation may be significant in our markets. X-ray mammography is a well-established method
of imaging the structures within the breast. Ultrasound is often used as an adjunct to help differentiate tumors and cysts. The CTLM 
is being marketed as an adjunct to mammography and will not compete directly with X-ray mammography. CTLM is, however, a method of
molecular functional imaging, which can visualize the process of angiogenesis which may be used to distinguish between benign and malignant
tissue. Unlike X-ray or ultrasound, optical molecular imaging is a revolutionary functional imaging modality. In this respect, CTLM 
may compete with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in breast imaging because both CTLM and MRI have the capacity to visualize function
at the molecular level. 

15 

To our knowledge, several companies have targeted
the breast optical imaging market. Advanced Research Technologies, Inc. (ART) (TSX:ARA) developed a non-3D imager which does not utilize
our proprietary continuous wave technology and in which the breast must be immersed in a gel to be scanned. As far as we know, ART has
not received a PMA and no information on the company or its product, SoftScan, is available since 2008. On February 18, 2013, ART Advanced
Research Technologies Inc. filed an assignment and KPMG Inc. was appointed as trustee of the estate of the bankrupt by the official receiver,
subject to affirmation by the creditors of the trustee s appointment or substitution of another trustee by the creditors. 

We expect, as patents on devices using lasers
as an energy source for optical imaging expire, to see medical device companies take an interest in laser imaging. IDSI has been a pioneer
in Diffuse Optical Tomography and has sold CTLM systems for commercial purposes. 

Several medical imaging companies such as Seno
Medical Instruments are developing devices that are multi-modality combining ultrasound with laser and could be viewed as competitive,
however, we are unaware of the launch of any such devices. 

We believe that we will face strong competition
in the coming years. Nonetheless, since new technologies and devices generally require substantial time for development and market acceptance,
we believe that we have a significant advantage due to our CFDA approval and launch of sales of our CTLM in the Chinese market. In
order to maintain our competitive advantages, we plan to increase our research and development efforts in order to enhance our existing
device and potentially develop new devices. We believe that ongoing innovation is a key to our success. 

PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

The rapid technological advancements that characterize
the medical device industry have led us to rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, and confidentiality
procedures and processes to protect our CTLM and other technologies that we have developed. Due to the rising maintenance costs and
limited usefulness of patents, we have shifted our policy for protection of our intellectual property to focus principally on trade secrets
and confidential procedures and processes; however, we intend to file for new patents in circumstances where we believe the additional
protection is cost-effective. We believe that this approach will adequately protect our intellectual property and competitive position
in China and our other main potential markets; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to protect
our intellectual property. 

Patent Licensing Agreement 

IDSI was formed in December 1993 for the sole
purpose of developing and commercializing Mr. Richard Grable s invention, a CT laser breast-imaging device (the Mammoscan ).
In June 1998, IDSI signed an exclusive patent license agreement with Richard Grable, which covered his patent for some of the CTLM 
technology. The term of the license was for the life of the patent (17 years) and any renewals of the patent, subject to termination under
specific conditions. The patent license agreement expired in June 2015, when the underlying patent expired. No royalties were paid under
the agreement because royalties were payable only following FDA marketing clearance, which did not occur before expiration and still has
not occurred.

We intend to file for patents where we believe
the cost of obtaining a patent is economically reasonable in relation to the expected protection obtained. In particular, we intend to
seek patents covering the key technology underlying the CTLM 3.0. There can be no assurances that any patent that we apply for will
be issued, or that any patents issued will protect our technology. If the patents we license or obtain are infringed upon, or if we are
required to defend any patent infringement cases brought against us that will require substantial capital, the expenditure of which we
might not be able to afford, we could be materially adversely affected. 

Except as to the CTLM 3.0, we do not believe
that we need additional patents in order to adequately protect our existing intellectual property in China, the United States and other
key potential markets for the CTLM however, we will continually evaluate this position in light of changing circumstances. 

MANUFACTURING 

We intend to have the CTLM manufactured by
medical device contract manufacturers; however, we may develop the capability for limited manufacturing at our headquarters facility if
the circumstances so warrant. Strategically, IDSI has developed certain in-house capabilities to protect trade secrets. Our ability to
utilize contract manufacturers to manufacture our products on a timely and cost-competitive basis may be compromised due to high medical
standards and FDA manufacturing requirements applicable to our product. We may be hindered by the lack of options for additional or replacement
parts for product specific components or materials. In the event that we are unable to obtain sufficient raw materials or components on
financially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, we may be faced with material adverse effects on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. 

In June 2017, we entered into a licensing agreement
with Xi an IDI to manufacture and sell the CTLM and related parts and accessories in China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. While
manufacturing capacity has been shifted to Xi an IDI, we have identified Sparton Corp., Strongsville, Ohio (NYSE:SPA) as a potential
contract manufacturer to manufacture the CTLM and certain components in the U.S. 

EMPLOYEES 

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had 4 full-time employees, not including
our CFO, who has been retained as a consultant. Two of our employees are employed in the areas of scientific, clinical and product research
and development. Our ability to develop our products and provide our services is dependent upon our recruiting, hiring and retaining qualified
technical personnel. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. On May 1, 2020, we furloughed all employees due to the COVID-19
pandemic. On September 15, 2020, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with the furloughed employees, converting them to independent
contractors who will provide services on an as needed basis for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite having work stoppages,
we still consider our relations with our personnel to be good. 

Due to the specialized scientific nature of our
business, we are highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. The
loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit key scientific, technical and managerial personnel in a timely
manner would be detrimental to our research and development programs and to our business. Our anticipated growth and expansion into areas
and activities requiring additional expertise, such as marketing, will require the addition of new management personnel. Competition for
qualified personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel
necessary for the development of our business. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel has been made more challenging with
the COVID-19 pandemic. 

17 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

CERTAIN FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS 

Our business and results of operations are subject
to numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are described below. The risks, uncertainties and other factors described
below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks, uncertainties and other factors not presently known to us or that we
currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. 

Any of the risks, uncertainties and other factors
could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and could cause the trading price
of our common stock to decline substantially. 

The ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic and
measures taken in response thereto have materially adversely affected IDSI s research and development and commercialization
activities and its financial condition, and the full impact of the pandemic will depend on future developments, which are highly
uncertain and cannot be predicted. 

The COVID-19
pandemic has materially and adversely impacted the worldwide economy and financial markets, which could lead to a prolonged economic recession. In
response, governments in China, the U.S., and around the world, have taken unprecedented monetary and fiscal policy actions, and there
is significant uncertainty as to the timing of stabilization and recovery. The Company s business and financial condition have been
adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic, political, and social consequences since March 2020, and this negative impact
has continued through the fiscal year 2022. The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to contain it may continue
and even worsen for many more months or even years. The following are some of the issues that the Company continues to face as a result
of the ongoing crisis: 

Prolonged
 recessionary concerns . The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant
 reduction of economic activity in the U.S. and China, as well as a significant increase in
 unemployment, which could lead to a prolonged economic recession; 

Inability
 to generate revenue from sales. S ales and marketing efforts in China have been substantially
 delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Inability
 to raise capital. The continuation of IDSI s operations and commercialization of
 the CTLM are highly dependent upon our ability to raise capital. The COVID-19 pandemic
 has made it more difficult to find investors who would be willing to invest during this time
 of uncertainty. 

Inability
 to make progress on our key R D project . The CTLM 3.0 project has been delayed
 due to our furloughing employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lack
 of funding. 

Risks related to our financial condition 

We have a history of losses and we expect to incur additional losses. 

We are a late-stage development stage company
with a limited history of operations, and we do not expect sufficient revenues to support our operations for at least the next 12 months.
Since our inception in December 1993, we have been engaged principally in the development of the CTLM , which has not received marketing
clearance for sale in the United States. While we have obtained FDA export approval for foreign sales, we have made only 26 foreign sales.
Consequently, we have limited experience in manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products. Since we have decided not to renew our
CE Mark for now and are not pursuing FDA marketing clearance at this time, we do not expect to receive revenues from sales of the CTLM 
systems in the EU or in the US for the foreseeable future. We currently have no source of material operating revenues and have incurred
substantial net operating losses since our inception. We do not expect to receive any sales revenues from China in the foreseeable future. 

To date, we have not been profitable, and our
accumulated deficit was 135,482,996 at June 30, 2022 after discounts and dividends on preferred stock. These losses have resulted principally
from costs associated with research and development, clinical trials and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.
While we seek to attain profitability, we cannot be sure that we will ever achieve sufficient revenue to attain this objective. 

We expect operating losses will continue for at
least the next 12 months due to lack of substantial revenues and potential additional expenses associated with: 

demonstration sites, 

clinical collaboration sites, 

18 

FDA Pre-Market Approval PMA needed for marketing
clearance, 

anticipated commercialization of the CTLM , and 

other research and development programs. 

Our auditors have raised substantial doubts
as to our ability to continue as a going concern as we have not been and may not be able to be profitable. 

We have received an opinion from our auditors
stating that the fact that we have suffered substantial losses and have yet to generate an internal cash flow raises substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to achieve profitability will depend on our ability to obtain regulatory
approvals for the CTLM , develop the capacity to manufacture and market the CTLM and achieve market acceptance of the CTLM .
There can be no assurance we will achieve profitability if and when we receive regulatory approvals for the development, commercial manufacturing
and marketing of the CTLM . 

We will require additional financing to
continue our operations. 

Our current cash position is not sufficient to
meet our working capital needs for the next 12 months based on the pace of our planned activities. To continue operations, we will require
additional funds to support our working capital requirements and any expansion or other activities. In the absence of such funding, we
will need to significantly reduce our clinical trials and other planned activities or suspend operations. 

Through June 30, 2022, we had a cumulative deficit
of 135,482,996. Our currently estimated annual expenses are approximately 1.5 million. In the year following receipt of the PMA for
our CTLM from the FDA, we anticipate that we will need approximately 5 million of additional funding to fully complete all necessary
stages in order to manufacture and market the CTLM in the United States and foreign countries, including funds for: 

research, engineering and development programs, 

pre-clinical and clinical testing of the family of products, 

regulatory processes, 

inventory, 

marketing programs, and 

operating expenses (including general and administrative
expenses). 

Our
future capital requirements depend on many factors, including the following: 

the progress of our research and development projects, 

the progress of pre-clinical and clinical testing on other
proposed products, 

the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals, 

the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing
any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; competing technological and market developments; changes and developments in
our existing collaborative, licensing and other relationships and the terms of any new collaborative, licensing and other arrangements
that we may establish, and 

the development of commercialization activities and arrangements. 

In addition, our fixed commitments are substantial
and would increase if additional agreements were entered into and additional personnel were retained. We do not expect to generate a positive
internal cash flow for at least 12 months due to an anticipated increase in marketing and manufacturing expenses associated with the international
commercialization of the CTLM , expenses associated with our FDA process, and the costs associated with advanced product development
activities. 

19 

Although we have from time-to-time reviewed opportunities
provided to us by investment bankers or potential investors in regard to additional equity financings, there can be no assurance that
additional financing will be available when needed, or if available, will be available on acceptable terms. Insufficient funds may prevent
us from implementing our business strategy and will require us to further delay, scale back or eliminate our research, product development
and marketing programs; and may require us to license to third parties rights to commercialize products or technologies that we would
otherwise seek to develop ourselves, or to scale back or eliminate our other operations. 

Risks related to our technologies 

We depend on third-party licensing agreements
for patents and software without which our operations may be curtailed. 

We own three United States patents related to
optical tomography. We also have several non-exclusive licensing agreements for software providing image reconstruction, backup, encryption
and DICOM from third-parties. If any of these agreements were terminated, our operations may be curtailed until alternative solutions
were found. 

Our business would lose its primary competitive
advantage if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology, or if substantially the same technology is developed by others. 

We rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets,
patents, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality procedures to protect our technology. Our ability to compete effectively in
the medical imaging products industry will depend on our success in protecting our proprietary technology in the United States, China
and other major countries. There can be no assurances that any patent that we apply for in the future will be issued, or that any patents
issued will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, that we will have the financial resources to enforce them, or that the rights
granted will provide any competitive advantage. We could incur substantial costs in defending any patent infringement suits or in asserting
any patent rights, including those granted by third parties, the expenditure of which we might not be able to afford. Although we have
entered into confidentiality and invention agreements with our employees and consultants, there can be no assurance that these agreements
will be honored or that we will be able to protect our rights to our non-patented trade secrets and know-how effectively. There can be
no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain
access to our trade secrets and know-how. In addition, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from
third parties. If we do not obtain required licenses, we could encounter delays in product development or find that the development, manufacture,
or sale of products requiring these licenses could be foreclosed. Additionally, we may, from time to time, support and collaborate in
research conducted by universities and governmental research organizations. There can be no assurance that we will have or be able to
acquire exclusive rights to the inventions or technical information derived from such collaborations or that disputes will not arise with
respect to rights in derivative or related research programs that we conducted in conjunction with these organizations. 

Even though we have received CFDA approval
to sell the CTLM systems in China, no sales in China have occurred yet. Until sales of the CTLM begin in China, our ability
to generate revenues from operations will be very limited and those revenues will be insufficient to sustain operations. Many factors
impact our ability to obtain FDA marketing clearance, and we may not obtain US regulatory approval at all. 

The only current approval for commercial sale
of the CTLM by a medical device regulatory authority is the CFDA approval, which allows us to market and sell the CTLM systems
in China. We believe that receiving FDA marketing clearance is crucial for marketing of the CTLM systems in the US, the EU and other
countries. After the Viable Acquisition, we restarted the PMA process for the CTLM in the United States and had an informational
meeting with the FDA on December 7, 2015. However, the PMA process was put on hold until more data is obtained from pilot studies being
conducted in China. If and when we restart the PMA process, pre-clinical and clinical trials of our products, and the manufacturing and
marketing of our technologies, will be subject to extensive, costly and rigorous regulation by governmental authorities in the United
States. The process of obtaining required regulatory approvals from the FDA and other regulatory authorities often takes many years, is
expensive, and can vary significantly based on the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates. Delays in obtaining United
States, or other foreign approvals for CTLM systems could result in substantial additional costs to us, and, therefore, could adversely
affect our ability to continue operations. Even if regulatory approval is ultimately granted in any country, the approval may place limitations
on the intended use of the CTLM , and may restrict the way in which we are permitted to market the CTLM . 

20 

It may be necessary to enter into unfavorable
agreements or defend lawsuits which would be costly if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. 

There has been substantial litigation regarding
patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device and related industries. We have been, and may be in the future, notified
that we may be infringing on intellectual property rights possessed by other third parties. If any claims are asserted against our intellectual
property rights, we may seek to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. There is a risk in situations that no license will be available
or that a license will not be available on reasonable terms. Alternatively, we may decide to litigate these claims or design around the
patented technology. These actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel.
Consequently, any infringement claims by third parties or other claims for indemnification by customers resulting from infringement claims,
whether or not proven to be true, may be costly to defend and may further limit the use of our technology. 

We may not be able to keep up with the rapid
technological change in the medical imaging industry which could make the CTLM obsolete. 

Methods for the detection of cancer are subject
to rapid technological innovation and there can be no assurance that technical changes will not render our proposed products obsolete.
Although we believe that the CTLM can be upgraded to maintain its state-of-the-art character, the development of new technologies
or refinements of existing ones might make our existing system technologically or economically obsolete, or cause a reduction in the value
of, or reduce the need for, our CTLM . There can be no assurance that the development and commercial availability of new types of
diagnostic medical equipment or technology will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of
operations. Although we are aware of no substantial technological changes pending in diffuse optical tomography, should a change occur,
there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire the new or improved technology which may be required to update the CTLM . 

Due to legal and factual uncertainties regarding
the scope and protection afforded by patents and other proprietary rights, we may not have meaningful protection from competition. 

Our long-term success will substantially depend
upon our ability to protect our proprietary technologies from infringement, misappropriation, discovery, and duplication and upon our
ability to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others. As time moves forward, many patents on optical tomography will be expiring
and be in the public domain. Our patent rights and the patent rights of biotechnology and medical device companies in general are highly
uncertain and include complex legal and factual issues. These uncertainties also mean that any patents that we own or will obtain in the
future could be subject to challenge, and, even if not challenged, they may not provide us with meaningful protection from competition.
Due to our financial uncertainties, we may not possess the financial resources necessary to enforce our patents. Patents already issued
to us or our pending applications may become subject to dispute, and any dispute could be resolved against us. 

Also because of these legal and factual uncertainties,
and because pending patent applications are held in secrecy for varying periods in the United States and other countries, even after reasonable
investigation we may not know with certainty whether any products that we (or a licensee) may develop will infringe upon any patent or
other intellectual property right of a third party. For example, we are aware of certain patents owned by third parties that such parties
could attempt to use in the future in efforts to affect our freedom to practice some of the patents that we own or have applied for. Based
upon the science and scope of these third-party patents, we believe that the patents that we own or have applied for do not infringe any
such third-party patents; however, we cannot know for certain whether we could successfully defend our position, if challenged. We may
incur substantial costs if we are required to defend our intellectual property in patent suits brought by third parties. These legal actions
could seek damages and seek to enjoin testing, manufacturing and marketing of the accused product or process. In addition to potential
liability for significant damages, we could be required to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market the accused product or
process. 

Several of our patents are due to expire
over the next few years. 

We have two US patents that are due to expire
in November 2023. There is no guarantee that we will be able to extend the life of these patents or to obtain additional patents, licenses,
or other instruments that can provide us with a comparable level of exclusivity to the intellectual property underlying the expiring patents.
If we cannot extend the life of these patents or obtain suitable replacements, we may lose competitive advantage. 

21 

Risks related to marketing of our products
and potential products 

We depend on market acceptance to sell our
products, which have not been proven, and a lack of acceptance would depress our sales. 

There can be no assurance that physicians or the
medical community in general will accept and utilize the CTLM or any other products that we develop. The extent and rate the CTLM 
achieves market acceptance and penetration will depend on many variables, including, but not limited to, the establishment and demonstration
in the medical community of the clinical safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the CTLM and the advantages of the CTLM 
over existing technology and cancer detection methods. 

There can be no assurance that the medical community
and third-party payers will accept our unique technology. Similar risks will confront any other products we develop in the future. Failure
of our products to gain market acceptance would hinder our sales efforts resulting in a loss of revenues and potential profit and, ultimately,
could cause our business to fail. 

Risks associated with our industry 

Lack of third-party reimbursement may have
a negative impact on the sales of our products, which would negatively impact our revenues. 

In the United States, suppliers of health care
products and services are greatly affected by Medicare, Medicaid and other government insurance programs, such as the Affordable Care
Act, as well as by private insurance reimbursement programs. Third-party payers (Medicare, Medicaid, private health insurance companies,
and other organizations) may affect the pricing or relative attractiveness of our products by regulating the level of reimbursement provided
by these payers to the physicians, clinics and imaging centers utilizing the CTLM or any other products that we may develop, by refusing
reimbursement. The level of reimbursement, if any, may impact the market acceptance and pricing of our products, including the CTLM .
Failure to obtain favorable rates of third-party reimbursement could discourage the purchase and use of the CTLM as a diagnostic
device. 

In international markets, reimbursement by private
third-party medical insurance providers, including governmental insurers and independent providers varies from country to country. In
addition, such third-party medical insurance providers may require additional information or clinical data prior to providing reimbursement
for a product or service. In some countries, our ability to achieve significant market penetration may depend upon the availability of
third-party governmental reimbursement. Revenues and profitability of medical device companies may be affected by the continuing efforts
of governmental and third-party payers to contain or reduce the cost of health care through various means. 

Competition in the medical imaging industry
may result in competing products, superior marketing and lower revenues and profits for us. 

The market in which we intend to participate is
highly competitive. Many of the companies in the cancer diagnostic and screening markets have substantially greater technological, financial,
research and development, manufacturing, human and marketing resources and experience than we do. These companies may succeed in developing,
manufacturing and marketing products that are more effective or less costly than our products. The competition for developing a commercial
device utilizing computed tomography techniques and laser technology is difficult to ascertain given the proprietary nature of the technology. 

To IDSI s knowledge, no other company has
a functioning diffuse optical tomographic imaging device in commercial service designed for use as an adjunct to mammography. CTLM 
systems were used in clinical settings in Italy, Germany, Poland, the Peoples Republic of China, Hungary, Malaysia, and United Arab Emirates.
Although not verified, end users have reported that approximately 25,000 breast exams have been performed on CTLM systems. Methods
for the detection of cancer are subject to rapid technological innovation and there can be no assurance that future technical changes
will not render our CTLM obsolete. There can be no assurance that the development of new types of diagnostic medical equipment or
technology will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

22 

Risks related to our business and operations 

We must comply with extensive governmental
regulations and have no assurance of receiving critical regulatory approvals or clearances, the lack of which could cause us to cut back
or cease operations. 

A delay or inability to obtain any necessary regulatory
clearances or approvals, especially in the US, for our products would prevent or hinder us from selling the CTLM system in China
and other countries. 

In the United States the CTLM is regulated
as a medical device and is subject to the FDA s requirements for marketing clearance. 

A PMA is the FDA process of scientific and regulatory
review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices. Class III devices are those that support or sustain human
life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potentially unreasonable risk of illness
or injury. Due to the level of risk associated with Class III devices, the FDA has determined that general and special controls alone
are insufficient to assure the safety and effectiveness of Class III devices. Therefore, these devices require a PMA application in order
to obtain marketing clearance. 

The FDA automatically classifies new technologies
in Class III when limited safety information is available and no predicate device is available. It allows for multiple clinical studies
to be pursued to gather the necessary data to obtain safety and clinical information to be used for future FDA submissions. At the time
that we were developing the CTLM system and considering marketing clearance, there was not enough data on laser-based technologies
nor were there approved other new medical devices dedicated to breast imaging other than the traditional x-ray technology. As a result,
the FDA recommended that we seek PMA approval. 

We depend upon suppliers with whom we have
no contracts, which suppliers could cause production disruption if they terminated or changed their relationships with us. 

We believe that there are a number of suppliers
for most of the components and subassemblies required for the CTLM however, at this time components for our laser system are provided
by one supplier. Although these components are provided by a limited number of other suppliers, we believe our laser supplier and their
products are the most reliable. We have no agreement with our laser supplier and purchase the laser components on an as-needed basis.
For certain services and components, we currently rely on single suppliers. If we encounter delays or difficulties with our third-party
suppliers in producing, packaging, or distributing components of the CTLM device, market introduction and subsequent sales would
be adversely affected. 

We have limited experience in sales, marketing
and distribution, which could negatively impact our ability to enter into collaborative arrangements or other third-party relationships
which are important to the successful development and commercialization of our products and potential profitability. 

We have limited internal marketing and sales resources
and personnel. In China, we must rely exclusively on Xi an IDI s ability to market and distribute the CTLM . There can
be no assurance that we will be able to establish sales and distribution capabilities or that we will be successful in gaining market
acceptance for any products we may develop. There can be no assurance that we or Xi an IDI will be able to recruit and retain skilled
sales, marketing, service or support personnel, that agreements with distributors will be available on terms commercially reasonable to
us, or at all, or that our marketing and sales efforts in the United States, China and/or elsewhere will be successful. 

There can be no assurance that we or Xi an
IDI will be able to further develop our distribution network on acceptable terms, if at all, or that any of our proposed marketing schedules
or plans can or will be met. 

We depend on qualified personnel to run
and develop our specialized business who we may be unable to retain or hire. 

Due to the specialized scientific nature
of our business, we are highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel.
The loss of the services of existing personnel, as well as the failure to recruit key scientific, technical and managerial personnel in
a timely manner would be detrimental to our research and development programs and could have an adverse impact upon our business affairs
and finances. Our anticipated growth and expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise, such as marketing, will require
the addition of new management personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be
able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business. 

23 

There may exist conflicts of interest on
the part of our officers and directors. 

Our directors and officers are or may become,
in their individual capacities, officers, directors, controlling shareholders and/or partners of other entities engaged in a variety of
businesses. Our officers and directors are engaged in business activities outside of the Company. There exist potential conflicts of interest
including, among other things, time, and effort as well as business combinations with other such entities. 

We have a limited manufacturing history
and must rely on contract manufacturers. 

In the United States we will have to contract
for the manufacture of the CTLM and its components in volumes that will be necessary for us to achieve significant commercial sales
in the event we begin substantial foreign sales outside of China and/or obtain regulatory approval to market our products in the United
States. We have limited experience in the manufacture of the CTLM . Should we elect to manufacture our products at our United States
facility, our manufacturing facility would be subject to the full range of the FDA s current quality system regulations. In China,
we will rely exclusively on Xi an IDI s ability to manufacture the CTLM efficiently and with the required quality. There
can be no assurance that the manufacturing efforts by our contractors in China and/or the United State, or by us if we choose to manufacture
directly, will be successful or cost-effective. 

We do not know if we will be able to produce
our products in commercial quantities. 

We have little experience manufacturing products
for large scale clinical testing or commercial purposes. We have only manufactured CTLM systems on the small scale needed for testing,
clinical trials, and a very limited number of approved foreign sales. We may encounter manufacturing and control problems as we attempt
to scale up. We may not be able to achieve such scale-up in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost, if at all. Our failure
to solve any of these problems could delay or prevent commercialization of our products and could seriously impact the amount of our revenues
and our results of operations. 

We depend on third parties who may not be
in compliance with the FDA s quality system regulations which may delay the approval or decrease the sales of the CTLM . 

We have used and do use third parties to manufacture
and deliver the components of the CTLM and intend to continue to use third parties to manufacture and deliver these components and
other products we may develop. There can be no assurance that the third-party manufacturers we depend on for the manufacturing of CTLM 
components will be in compliance with the quality system regulations (QSR) at the time of the pre-approval inspection or will maintain
compliance afterwards. This failure could significantly delay FDA marketing clearance approval for the CTLM device. 

We will rely on international sales and
may be subject to risks associated with international commerce. 

In June 2017, we entered into a Technology Licensing
Agreement (the Xi an Agreement with Xi an IDI Laser Image Co. Ltd. Xi an IDI ), of Xi an,
Shaanxi Province, China. Xi an IDI is an affiliate of Viable. Pursuant to the Xi an Agreement, Xi an IDI has the exclusive
right to manufacture the CTLM in China and sell the CTLM in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Xi an IDI must pay to
IDSI on a quarterly basis a royalty of 25 of the gross revenues from the sale of the CTLM and related parts and accessories. We
recognize the potential market for the CTLM in the European Union (EU), South America and the Middle East. However, we are initially
focusing on those countries that can be serviced by Xi an IDI. Marketing in the Middle East can be problematic as some of the countries
in the Middle East are subject to economic sanctions and political instability. In this regard, IDSI is not marketing and will not market
the CTLM in countries that are subject to such sanctions, and IDSI has and will have no agreements, commercial arrangements, or other
contacts with the government or entities controlled by the government in any such country for so long as the sanctions remain in place.
Until we receive marketing clearance from the FDA to market the CTLM in the United States, our revenues, if any, will be derived
from sales by Xi an IDI in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau and sales to international distributors. A significant portion of
our revenues may be subject to the risks associated with international sales, including: 

economic and political instability, 

shipping delays, 

fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates, 

restrictions on our ability to repatriate funds from foreign
jurisdictions, 

24 

foreign regulatory requirements, 

various tariffs and other trade restrictions, all of which
could have a significant impact on our ability to deliver products on a timely and cost-effective basis, and 

inability to collect outstanding receivables to the extent
that irrevocable letters of credit are not used. 

Significant increases in the level of customs
duties, export quotas or other trade restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. The regulation of medical devices in foreign countries continues to develop, and there can be no assurance that new laws
or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us. In order to minimize the risk of doing business with distributors in countries
which are having difficult financial times, our international distribution agreements may require payment via an irrevocable letter of
credit drawn on a United States bank prior to shipment of the CTLM . 

Risks related to potential liabilities 

We face significant product liability risks,
which may have a negative effect on our financial condition. 

The use of medical devices, whether in clinical
trials or commercially, can result in product liability claims whether or not the devices and treatments are actually at fault for causing
an injury. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and may result in large judgments or settlements against us, which could
have a severe negative effect on our financial condition. Due to factors in the insurance market generally and our own experience, we
may not be able to purchase sufficient product liability insurance at an affordable price. Even if a product liability claim is not successful,
the adverse publicity and time and expense of defending such a claim may interfere with our business. 

Improper disclosure of clinical data, personal
data, and other confidential data could result in liability and harm our reputation . 

As we continue to perform clinical studies, expand
our sales, and improve our capabilities with initiatives like IDSI Cloud, we store and process increasingly large amounts of confidential
data, including medical information and personally identifiable information. At the same time, the continued occurrence of high-profile
data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. This environment demands that
we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls across our business and geographies. Despite these efforts, it
is possible our security controls over medical, personal, and other confidential data, our training of employees and vendors on data security,
and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of confidential information that we or our vendors store and manage.
Improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under
laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. 

Risks related to the market for our common
stock 

Our common stock is considered a
penny stock and may be difficult to sell. 

The SEC adopted regulations which generally define
 penny stock to be an equity security that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than
 5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. We expect the market price of our common stock to remain substantially less than 5.00
per share in the foreseeable future, and our stock therefore may be designated as a penny stock according to SEC rules.
This designation requires any broker or dealer selling these securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain
a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules
may restrict the ability of brokers or dealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their shares.
In addition, since we expect our common stock to be quoted on the OTC Markets, investors may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations
of our common stock. 

25 

The price of our common stock may be affected
by a limited trading volume, may fluctuate significantly and may not reflect the actual value of our business. 

There may arise a limited public market for our
common stock on the OTC Markets; however, there can be no assurance that an active trading market will materialize. An absence of an active
trading market could adversely affect our stockholders ability to sell our common stock in short time periods, if at all. Our common
stock has experienced, and is likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect
the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, we believe that factors, such as our sale
of securities in connection with capital raising activities, could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. Thus,
the price at which shares of our common stock may trade from time to time may not reflect the actual value of our business or the actual
value of our common stock. 

From time to time, we may hire companies to assist
us in pursuing investor relations strategies to generate increased volumes of investment in our common stock. Such activities may result,
among other things, in causing the price of our common stock to increase on a short-term basis. 

Risks related to ownership of our common
stock 

There is currently no trading for our common
stock 

Outstanding shares of our Common Stock cannot
be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred in the U.S. unless subsequently registered pursuant to, or exempt from registration
under, the Securities Act and any other applicable federal or state securities laws or regulations. These restrictions will limit the
ability of our stockholders to liquidate their investment. 

The volatility of our stock price could
adversely affect your investment in our common stock. 

The price of our common stock fluctuated substantially
after it began trading on the OTC Bulletin Board in September 1994. Furthermore, in September 2014 the registration of our common stock
was revoked for failure to file annual and quarterly reports by the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and there has been
no trading market for the common stock since then. 

Even if a trading market for our stock is re-established,
the market price of our shares, like that of the common stock of many other medical device companies, is likely to be highly volatile.
Factors that may have an impact on the price of our common stock include: 

the timing and results of our clinical trials or those of
our competitors, 

governmental regulation, 

healthcare legislation, 

geopolitical events, 

equity or debt financing, and 

developments in patent or other proprietary rights pertaining
to our competitors or us, including litigation, fluctuations in our operating results, and market conditions for medical device company
stocks and life science stocks in general. 

We have not paid and do not currently intend
to pay dividends, which may limit the current return you may receive on your investment in our common stock. 

Since inception, we have not paid a dividend on
our common stock and do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations 

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis should be
read in conjunction with the condensed financial statements and other financial data included elsewhere in this report. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The financial statements are prepared in accordance
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Such estimates and assumptions also include the valuations of certain financial instruments, stock-based
compensation, deferred tax assets, the outcome of litigation and tax matters, and other matters that affect the statements of financial
condition and related disclosures. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. 

We believe the following critical accounting policies
affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

We rely on the guidance provided by ASC 718, Share
Based Payments ). ASC 718 requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and similar awards and applies to all
outstanding and vested stock-based awards. 

In computing the impact, the fair value of each
option is estimated on the date of grant based on the Black-Scholes options-pricing model utilizing certain assumptions for a risk-free
interest rate; volatility; and expected remaining lives of the awards. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based
payment awards represent management s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of
management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, the Company s stock-based compensation expense
could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize
expense for those shares expected to vest. In estimating the Company s forfeiture rate, we analyzed its historical forfeiture rate,
the remaining lives of unvested options, and the amount of vested options as a percentage of total options outstanding. If our actual
forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate, or if the Company reevaluates the forfeiture rate in the future, the stock-based
compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period. No stock options were granted
during the year ended June 30, 2022. During the year ended June 30, 2021 the Board granted options to purchase 157,102 shares with an
exercise price of .51 per share to an employee and 1,500,000 shares with an exercise price of .51 per share to a consultant. These options
are being expensed pursuant to ASC 718. 

The fair value concepts were not changed significantly
in ASC 718; however, in adopting this Standard, companies were given the option to choose among alternative valuation models and amortization
assumptions. We elected to continue to use the Black-Scholes option pricing model and expense the options as compensation over the requisite
service period of the grant. We will reconsider use of the Black-Scholes model if additional information becomes available in the future
that indicates another model would be more appropriate, or if grants issued in future periods have characteristics that cannot be reasonably
estimated using this model. 

Results of Operations 

In the continuing process of commercializing our
operations and as part of our transition plan to exit from reporting as a development stage enterprise, we will use the current format
of our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation (MD A) to better disclose and discuss
four main categories of expenses (general and administrative, salaries and wages, research and development, sales and marketing, consulting,
and bad debt). 

29 

Years Ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 

SALES AND COST OF SALES 

Revenues during the years ended June 30, 2022
and 2021, were 0. 

Our cost of sales during both years ended June
30, 2021 and 2020 was 0. 

Our sales and marketing efforts been significantly hindered by the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore we do not expect revenue in the foreseeable future. 

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE 

Our general and administrative expenses include
travel/subsistence related to general and administrative activities, property and casualty insurance, professional fees associated with
our corporate and securities attorneys and independent auditors, corporate governance expenses, stockholder expenses, utilities, maintenance,
telephones, office supplies and sales and property taxes. 

General and administrative expenses during the
year ended June 30, 2022 were 92,032, representing a decrease of 51,819 or 36 from 143,851, during the year ended June 30, 2021. 

The general and administrative decrease of 51,819 is due primarily
to a decrease in rent and auto payments as lease agreements were terminated during fiscal 2021. There were also reductions in other expenses
due to the reduction in business activity during fiscal 2022 because of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. 

We do not expect a material change in our general
and administrative expenses until we realize a significant increase in revenue from the sale of our product. 

SALARIES AND WAGES 

Our salaries and wages expenses include compensation,
related benefits, payroll taxes and other payroll fees for all employees. 

Salaries and wages expense during the years ended
June 30, 2022 and 2021, was 0. 

The lack of salaries and wages is due to the Company s decision
to furlough all employees on May 1, 2020 in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Some of these individuals have worked as independent contractors
on an as-needed basis. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

We incur research and development expenses to
develop significant enhancements to our sole product, the CTLM . These expenses consist primarily of clinical costs, costs of materials
and components to make product enhancements, new product research costs, and costs associated with servicing clinical collaboration sites. 

Research and development expenses during the year
ended June 30, 2022 were 1,730, representing a decrease of 6,669 or 79 from 8,399, during the year ended June 30, 2021. 

The decrease of 6,669 is due primarily to the
Company not renewing the UL Certification during fiscal 2022. 

SALES AND MARKETING 

Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily
of expenses associated with advertising and promotion, representative office expense, trade shows, conferences, promotional and training
costs related to marketing the CTLM , commissions, travel/subsistence, patent maintenance fees, consulting, certification expenses,
and product liability insurance. 

30 

Sales and marketing expenses during the year ended
June 30, 2022 were 824, representing an increase of 2 or less than 1 from 822, during the year ended June 30, 2021. 

All sales and marketing expenses during fiscal 2022 and 2021 were related
to fees for maintaining our website. The minor difference relates to variations in website related fees between the two periods. 

CONSULTING EXPENSES 

Our consulting expenses consist of all consulting
fees paid as well as share-based compensation issued to our consultants. Our share-based compensation expense consists of vested stock
options expensed under the Black-Scholes options pricing model. 

Consulting expenses for the year ended June 30,
2022 were 470,971, representing a decrease of 13,868 or 3 from 484,839, during the year ended June 30, 2021. 

The decrease in consulting expenses is due to
the slight reduction in services from our consultants during fiscal 2022. 

BAD DEBT EXPENSE 

Bad debt expenses represent accounts receivable
and amounts due from related parties that have been reserved. 

Bad debt expenses for the year ended June 30,
2022, were 0 representing an increase of 18,815 from (18,815) during the year ended June 30, 2021. 

The increase is due to the Company recovering
 7,700 of accounts receivable and 11,115 of amounts due from related parties in fiscal 2021 that had been previously written off as bad
debt. 

AGGREGATE OPERATING EXPENSES 

Total operating expenses (general and administrative,
salaries and wages, research and development, sales and marketing, depreciation and amortization, consulting, and bad debt) and cost of
sales during the year ended June 30, 2022 were 565,557, representing a decrease of 54,161 or 9 from 619,718 when compared to the operating
expenses and cost of sales during the year ended June 30, 2021. The overall decrease in expenses is due primarily to the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic which required us to further streamline operations and reduce costs. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses during
the year ended June 30, 2022 were 0 representing a decrease of 622 or 100 from 622 during the year ended June 30, 2021. There was
no depreciation expense during fiscal 2022 since there were no asset purchases and all existing assets have been fully depreciated as
of the end of fiscal 2021. 

Interest expense during the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2022 was 81,772, representing an increase of 888 or 1 from 80,884, during the year ended June 30, 2021. The average balance
of interest bearing outstanding debt during fiscal 2022 and 2021 were approximately the same. 

BALANCE SHEET DATA 

Our combined cash and cash equivalents totaled
 613 at June 30, 2022 and 2,473 at June 30, 2021. We do not expect to generate a positive internal cash flow for at least the next
12 months due to our efforts to generate sales in China and obtain FDA marketing clearance, the expected costs of commercializing our
initial product, the CTLM , and the time required for homologations from certain countries. 

Our inventory, which consists of raw materials,
work in process (including completed units under testing), and finished goods totaled 100,087 at June 30, 2022 and 2021. Raw materials
used for research and development or other purposes are expensed and not included in inventory. The net inventory is 0 for fiscal 2022
and 2021 because the Company has booked a reserve for the entire value of the inventory due to lack of demand for parts and lack of sales. 

Our property and equipment, net, totaled 0 at
June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021. All property and equipment had been fully depreciated as of the end of fiscal 2021, and no new
property and equipment were purchased during fiscal 2022. 

31 

Our current liabilities, which consist of accounts
payable, accrued payroll taxes and penalties, short term debt, and convertible debt, totaled 1,825,542 at June 30, 2022 and 1,378,461
at June 30, 2021. Accounts payable and accrued expenses totaled 767,317 at June 30, 2022 and 472,571 at June 30, 2021. Accrued payroll
taxes and penalties totaled 314,019 at June 30, 2022 and 314,019 at June 30, 2021. Related party promissory notes totaled 671,276 at
June 30, 2022 and 581,276 at June 30, 2021. The current portion of long-term debt was 72,930 at June 30, 2022 and 10,595 at June 30,
2021. Current liabilities increased primarily due to accounts payable and accrued expenses increasing by 294,746, increase in related
party promissory notes of 90,000, and the entire balance of PPP loan payable becoming a current liability due to loan default during
fiscal 2022. 

Our long-term liabilities, which consist of long term loans payable
totaled 0 at June 30, 2022 and 69,005 at June 30, 2021. The decrease in long-term liabilities was due to the entire balance of the PPP
loan payable becoming a current liability due to loan default during fiscal 2022. 

Our temporary equity, which consists of Convertible
Preferred Series L (including accrued dividends), totaled 433,939 at June 30, 2022 and 415,939 at June 30, 2021. The increase of 18,000
is due to accrued dividends for fiscal 2021 that are being included in the total redemption value. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

We are currently a development stage company and
our continued existence is dependent upon our ability to resolve our liquidity problems, principally by obtaining additional debt and/or
equity financing. We have yet to generate a positive internal cash flow, and until significant sales of our product occur, we are
mostly dependent upon debt and equity funding from Viable and its affiliates and/or outside investors. While Viable has stated its intention
to provide, directly or through private investors it procures, the working capital that we need for the next 12 months, in the event that
we are unable to obtain adequate debt or equity financing or are unable to obtain such financing on terms and conditions acceptable to
us, we may have to cease or severely curtail our operations. This would materially impact our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We have financed our operating and research and development activities
through multiple private placements of common stock as well as short term loans from related parties. During fiscal 2022, we received
 90,000 through short-term related party loans. During fiscal 2021 we received proceeds of 61,276 through short-term related party loans. 

Net cash used for operating and product development
expenses, which include our purchase of additional materials to continue the manufacture of CTLM Systems in anticipation of receiving
orders from our distributors in certain countries, where permitted by law, was 85,190 during fiscal 2022, compared to net cash used by
operating activities and product development of the CTLM and related software development of 104,763 during fiscal 2021. At
June 30, 2022, we had negative working capital of 1,812,940 compared to negative working capital of 1,358,037 at June 30, 2021. We do
not expect to generate a positive internal cash flow for at least the next 12 months due to the time needed to ramp up our sales and marketing
plan in China. 

If and when we receive marketing clearance from
the FDA, which cannot be assured, we believe that we will need funding in excess of 5 million above and beyond normal operating expenses
over the following year to fully complete all necessary stages in order for us to market the CTLM in the United States and foreign
countries other than China. In China Xi an IDI will be responsible for all expenses relating to the manufacture, marketing and sale
of the CTLM . The 5 million will be used to purchase inventory, sub-contracted components, tooling and manufacturing templates
and pay non-recurring engineering costs associated with preparation for full capacity manufacturing and assembly and marketing, advertising
and promotion, training, ongoing regulatory expenses, and other costs associated with product launch. We expect to use the proceeds
of the sale of restricted common stock through private placements as our preferred choice to raise the additional funds required to continue
operations. In the event that we are unable to raise funds through private placements, of common or preferred stock, or debt securities,
or combinations thereof; we will be materially adversely affected and may have to cease operations. If additional funds are raised
by issuing equity securities, dilution to existing stockholders will result, and future investors may be granted rights superior to those
of existing stockholders. 

Through the date of this report, IDSI has been
taking drastic measures as a response to the global COVID-19 crisis to preserve working capital. These measures include the conversion
of our full-time employees to contractors working on an as-needed basis, deferral of payments to vendors, and transition of our facilities
to a smaller, more cost-efficient space.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
Imaging Diagnostic Systems, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Imaging Diagnostic Systems, Inc. (the Company) as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations, stockholders 
deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year
period ended June 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Explanatory Paragraph Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, as of June 30, 2022
the Company had an accumulated deficit of 135,482,996 and a stockholder s deficit of 2,246,879. For the year ended June 30, 2022,
net loss totaled 647,329 and a net cash used in operating activities of 85,190. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to
the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

We did not identify any critical audit matters
that need to be communicated.

a stockholders deficit
of , and a working capital deficiency of . For the year ended June 30, 2022, net loss totaled . The net cash
used in operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2022 totaled . These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the date these financial statements are issued. The ability
of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon generating sales and obtaining additional capital and financing. While
the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate material sales volume and in its ability to raise additional funds,
there can be no assurances to that effect. The Company received from the Chinese FDA CFDA marketing clearance for the
CTLM effective November 16, 2018 to November 15, 2023. However, there can be no assurance that we will obtain U.S. Food and Drug
Administration FDA marketing or other new international marketing clearances, that the CTLM will achieve market acceptance
or that sufficient revenues will be generated from sales of the CTLM in China or elsewhere to allow us to operate profitably. Since
2016, we have financed our operations through loans by Viable International Investments, LLC Viable ), our majority shareholder,
and its affiliates and the private placement of common stock to Viable affiliates and independent Chinese investors. We do not have any
formal financing arrangements with Viable and its affiliates; however, Viable has stated its intention to continue to provide financing
of our operations consistent with past practice. While we believe that Viable and its affiliates will provide on commercially reasonable
terms the funding we need until we achieve a positive cash flow from operations. There can be no assurance that we will receive such funding
or that we will ever achieve profitability. If Viable fails to continue funding, the Company would be materially adversely affected and
may have to cease operations due to a lack of funding. These matters affect the Company s liquidity profile, and management s
plans in those regards are discussed in the paragraphs that follow.

deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial losses and the tax basis of assets

requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets. Internal Revenue
Code Section 382 IRC 382 places a limitation on the amount of taxable income that can be offset by carry forwards after
a change in control (generally greater than a change in ownership). The issuance of the Company s Series M Preferred Stock on
August 4, 2014 resulted in a change of control as defined under IRC 382. As of the change of control date,

. Because the Company
was de-registered and OTC markets did not provide a quote for IMDS, there is no public market for the Company s shares. Given the
exercise prices adjusted for the reverse split, it is highly unlikely that any employee holding pre-2016 Plan options will exercise them.
The Company has sufficient authorized shares available for all outstanding option; however, if exercised, the shares will be issued with
a restrictive legend because the Company was not an SEC reporting company until October 2018. Further, given its recent return to SEC
reporting status, the Company is unable to file an S-8 Registration Statement to register shares issued because of option exercise pursuant
to various stock option agreements.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions, and Director Independence 

Related Party Transactions 

Viable International Investments, LLC, a Florida
limited liability company Viable ), owns 70.73 of IDSI s outstanding common stock. Viable is owned 72 by Viable
China, which is beneficially owned by Lixin Wang, and 28 by Invescope, LLC, a Florida limited liability company beneficially owned by
Paul Yang, the brother of Lixin Yang. Viable and its affiliates have been our main source of capital since the Viable Acquisition. 

In June 2017, IDSI entered into a licensing agreement
with Xi an IDI which grants to Xi an IDI the exclusive right to manufacture the CTLM in China and market and sell the
CTLM in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. Under this agreement, Xi an IDI must pay to IDSI a royalty of 25 of its gross
sales of CTLM systems. Also, IDSI sells inventory parts to Xi an IDI or acquires parts from third parties on behalf of Xi an
IDI. During the year ended June 30, 2021 there were no sales made to Xi an IDI pursuant to this agreement. A majority of the shares
of Xi an IDI are beneficially owned by Lixin Yang. 

Since the Viable Acquisition in August 2014, Paul
Yeung has provided consulting services to the Company through Erhfort, LLC, a Florida limited liability company Erhfort in exchange for a fee of 8,500 per month for fiscal 2022 and 2021. In his consulting capacity, Mr. Yeung, who lives in Orlando, Florida,
regularly reviews the Company s operations and reports to IDSI s CEO Chunming Zhang, who lives in China. From August 2014
through August 2015, Erhfort s fees were paid by Viable. Since September 2015, Erhfort s fees have been paid by IDSI. 

36 

We expect that our board will adopt a written
policy for the review of related party transactions. For purposes of the policy, a related party transaction will include transactions
in which (1) the amount involved in any consecutive 12-month period is more than the lesser of (i) 120,000 or (ii) one percent of IDSI s
average total assets at year-end in the prior two completed fiscal years, (2) IDSI is a participant, and (3) any related party has a direct
or indirect material interest. The policy is expected to define a related party to include directors, nominees for director,
executive officers, beneficial owners of more than 5 of IDSI s outstanding common stock and their respective immediate family members.
Pursuant to the policy, all related party transactions must be approved by IDSI s board of directors or, in the event of an inadvertent
failure to bring the transaction to the board, ratified by the board. In the event that a member of the board has an interest in a related
party transaction, the transaction must be approved or ratified by the disinterested members of the board. In deciding whether to approve
or ratify a related party transaction, the board will consider the following factors: 

whether the terms of the transaction are (1) fair to IDSI
and (2) at least as favorable to IDSI as would apply if the transaction did not involve a related party; 

whether there are demonstrable business reasons for IDSI
to enter into the transaction; 

whether the transaction would impair the independence of
an outside director under IDSI s director independence standards; and 

whether the transaction would present an improper conflict
of interest for any director or executive officer, taking into account the size of the transaction, the overall financial position of
the related party, the direct or indirect nature of the related party s interest in the transaction and the ongoing nature of any
proposed relationship, and any other factors the committee deems relevant. 

Independent Directors 

IDSI currently has no independent director.
