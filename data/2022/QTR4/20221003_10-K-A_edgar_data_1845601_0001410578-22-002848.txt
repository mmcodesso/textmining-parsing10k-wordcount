 EXPLANATORY NOTE Iron Spark I Inc. (the Company, we , our or us is filing this Amendment No. 1 to its Annual Report on Form 10-K (this Amendment to amend its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2021, originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), on March 31, 2022, to restate its financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and for the period from January 22, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, its unaudited financial statements as of September 30, 2021, for the three months ended September 30, 2021, and for the period from January 22, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2021, and its unaudited financial statements as of June 30, 2021, for the three months ended June 30, 2021, and for the period from January 22, 2021 (inception) through June 30, 2021 (the Original Financial Statements in the accompanying notes to the financial statements included in this Amendment, including describing the restatement and its impact on previously reported amounts. In the Original Financial Statements, the Company incorrectly omitted certain expenses related to Nasdaq fees for the initial listing of the Company. Management previously concluded that a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting existed relating to the accounting treatment for complex financial instruments and that the failure to properly account for such items, including the omission of certain material Nasdaq fee accruals, constituted a material weakness as defined in the SEC regulations. In light of this material weakness, on September 30, 2022, the Company s management and the Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors, concluded that the Company s Original Financial Statements should no longer be relied upon and that it is appropriate to restate the Company s financial statements for such periods. The adjustment to correct accrual of the Nasdaq fee resulted in non-cash financial statement corrections and had no impact on the Company s current or previously reported cash position, operating expenses or total operating, investing or financing cash flows. We are filing this Amendment to amend and restate the Original Financial Statements with modification as necessary to reflect the restatements. The following items have been amended to reflect the restatements: Part II, Item 9A Controls and Procedures In addition, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have provided new certifications dated as of the date of this filing in connection with this Form 10-K/A (Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, 32.1 and 32.2). In addition to the omitted Nasdaq fees as described above, the Company is updating the unaudited financial statements as of June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021 for accounting related to the over-allotment option liability held by the underwriters in connection with the partial exercise of the over-allotment option. Except as described above, no other information included in the Original Financial Statements is being amended or updated by this Amendment and, other than as described herein, this Amendment does not purport to reflect any information or events subsequent to the Original Financial Statements. This Amendment continues to describe the conditions as of the date of the Original Financial Statements and, except as expressly contained herein, we have not updated, modified or supplemented the disclosures contained in the Original Financial Statements. Accordingly, this Amendment should be read in conjunction with the Original Financial Statements and with our filings with the SEC subsequent to the original filing.

Our Sponsor is Iron Spark I LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Sponsor ).

The Registration Statement for our initial public offering was declared effective on June 8, 2021 (the Initial Public Offering, or IPO ). On June 11, 2021, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 15,000,000 Class A common stock, par value 0.0001 per share (the Class A Common Stock at 10.00 per share of Class A Common Stock, generating gross proceeds of 150,000,000.

Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we completed the private sale of 1,090,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (the Private Placement Shares at a purchase price of 10.00 per Private Placement Share (the Private Placement ), to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of 10,900,000. A total of 173,472,000 10.00 per share of Class A Common Stock) of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the Private Placement was placed in a trust account (the Trust Account located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, and invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of one hundred eighty-five (185) days or less, or in money market funds meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as otherwise permitted under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.

 and assets with a global reach. We have not selected any specific business combination target. Additionally, we have not engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate.

We believe we will greatly benefit from the experiences of our executive officers and directors as we seek to identify and consummate an initial business combination. Our team has extensive experience in the financial services sector as investors, managers, principals, advisors or directors of operating companies. They also have extensive experience in identifying, negotiating with and conducting due diligence on companies targeted for acquisition and consummating acquisitions in the technology sector. Prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we intend to leverage the industry experience of our executive officers and board, including their extensive contacts, relationships and access to acquisition opportunities. While our management team does have experience pursuing an acquisition on behalf of a blank check company, past performance by our management team is not a guarantee of success with respect to locating a target business to acquire or any business combination we may consummate. The past performance of the members of our management team or their affiliates is not a guarantee that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of the performance of our management team or any of its affiliates performance as indicative of our future performance. If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Competition In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. 
 8 

Table of Contents 
 Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80 of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number of our outstanding Class B common stock and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination. Employees We currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. For additional discussion of the general development of our business, see our final prospectus on Form 424B4, filed with the SEC on June 10, 2021. Item 1A. Risk Factors. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to make disclosures under this Item. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. Not applicable. Item 2. Properties. We currently maintain our executive offices at 125 N Cache St., 2nd FL., Box 3789, Jackson, WY 83001. On June 8, 2021, we agreed to pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We may be subject to legal proceedings, investigations and claims incidental to the conduct of our business from time to time. We are not currently a party to any material litigation or other legal proceedings brought against us. We are also not aware of any legal proceeding, investigation or claim, or other legal exposure that has a more than remote possibility of having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Market Information Our Class A common stock began to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market, or Nasdaq, under the symbol ISAA on June 9, 2021.

The Private Placement Shares were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering. The Private Placement Shares are identical to the Class A Common Stock sold in the IPO. Additionally, our Sponsor has agreed not to transfer, assign, or sell any of the Private Warrants or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the Registration Statement) until the date that is 30 days after the date we complete our initial business combination. Our Sponsor were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Placement Shares. As of June 16, 2021, a total of 173,472,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placements (as defined below) was deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company s public stockholders at Morgan Stanley maintained by Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to (i) pay our tax obligations or (ii) for working capital purposes (but not to exceed 200,000 annually) (less up to 100,000 interest to pay dissolution expenses), the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of (a) the completion of our initial business combination, (b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-business combination activity, and (c) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law.

Overview We are a blank check company incorporated on January 22, 2021 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our initial business combination . We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering (the Initial Public Offering and the private placement of the Private Placement Shares (as defined below), the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of the Initial Public Offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. Our only activities for the period from January 22, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and, after the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents held after the Initial Public Offering. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the period from January 22, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of 1,012,145, which resulted from operating and formation costs of 894,112 and franchise tax expense of 187,945, offset in part by interest income on the Trust Account of 7,812 and the change in fair value of the over-allotment option of 62,100. Liquidity and Capital Resources On June 11, 2021, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 15,000,000 shares of Class A common stock (the Public Shares at 10.00 per Public Share, generating gross proceeds of 150,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 1,090,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price of 10.00 per share (the Private Placement Shares ), generating gross proceeds of 10,900,000. On June 16, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment option and purchased an additional 1,680,000 shares (the Over-Allotment Shares ), and the sale of an additional 100,800 shares (the Over-Allotment Private Placement Shares at 10.00 per share, generating total gross proceeds of 1,008,000. For the period from January 22, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was 1,088,818, which was due to our net loss of 1,012,145, change in fair value of the over-allotment option of 62,100, interest income on the Trust

Table of Contents 
 Account of 7,812, and changes in working capital of 185,462, offset in part by the amortization of prepaid expenses and other assets of 171,582 and formation and operating costs of 7,119. For the period from January 22, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities of 173,472,000 was the result of the amount of net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Shares being deposited to the Trust Account. For the period from January 22, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was 175,055,511, which was comprised of the net proceeds from the initial public offering, net of underwriter s discount paid of 163,464,000, proceeds from the sale of private placement shares of 11,908,000, and proceeds from the sale of common stock to the Sponsor of 25,000, offset in part by payment of offering costs of 341,489. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash of 494,693 held outside the trust account. We intend to use the funds held outside the trust account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a business combination. In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the Company s directors and officers may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required Working Capital Loans ). We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds following the Initial Public Offering in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business prior to our initial business combination. However, if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of public shares upon completion of our business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. In addition, we intend to target businesses larger than we could acquire with the net proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement shares and may as a result be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2021. Contractual Obligations Due to Related Party An affiliate of the Sponsor has paid 163,715 to cover certain operating costs and offering costs on behalf of the Company. The outstanding balance is due on-demand. Registration Rights The holders of the Founder Shares and Private Placement Shares that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans will have registration rights to require the Company to register a sale of any of its securities held by them pursuant to a registration rights agreement. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of a business combination. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.

 Underwriting Agreement The Company granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to 2,250,000 additional shares of Class A common stock to cover over-allotments at the Initial Public Offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions. On June 16, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option and purchased an additional 1,680,000 Over-Allotment Shares for an aggregate purchase price of 16,800,000. The remaining 570,000 shares were not exercised by the underwriter and expired on July 26, 2021. The underwriter was paid a cash underwriting fee of 0.20 per share, or 3,336,000 in the aggregate, upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. In addition, 0.35 per share, or 5,838,000 in the aggregate will be payable to the underwriter for deferred underwriting commissions. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies : Common stock subject to possible redemption All of the 16,680,000 shares of Class A common stock sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company s liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. In accordance with SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in Accounting Standards Codification ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require common stock subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Therefore, all Class A common stock has been classified outside of permanent equity. The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable common stock are affected by charges against additional paid in capital and accumulated deficit. Net Loss Per Common Share Net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, excluding shares of common stock subject to forfeiture. As the Public Shares are considered to be redeemable at fair value, and a redemption at fair value does not amount to a distribution different than other stockholders, Class A and Class B common stock are presented as one class of stock in calculating net loss per share. As a result, the calculated net loss per share is the same for Class A and Class B shares of common stock. At December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into shares of common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share for the period presented. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. As of December 31, 2021, we were not subject to any market or interest rate risk. Following the consummation of our Initial Public Offering, the net proceeds of our Initial Public Offering, including amounts in the Trust Account, have been invested in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in certain money market funds that invest solely in U.S. treasuries. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. This information appears following Item 16 of this Amendment No. 1 to Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. In connection with the preparation of this Amendment No. 1 to Form 10-K, we revised our prior position on accounting for redeemable ordinary shares. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective, due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to the Company s accounting for complex financial instruments within the Company s restatement of its June 11, 2021 8-K Balance Sheet and unaudited financial statements as of and for the period ended June 30, 2021 to reclassify the Company s redeemable ordinary shares, and the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to the Company s omission of certain material Nasdaq fee accruals as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 31, 2022 and as described in the Explanatory Note of this Amendment, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2021. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness described in the Explanatory Note of this Amendment resulted in the restatement of the Company s audited financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and unaudited financial statements as of and for the periods ended September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021. As a result, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements We revised our prior position on accounting for redeemable ordinary shares and restated our June 11, 2021 8-K Balance Sheet and unaudited financial statements as of and for the period ended June 30, 2021 filed on November 18, 2021 to reclassify our redeemable ordinary shares as described in Note 3 of the accompanying financial statements. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Other than the implementation of the material weakness remediation activities described below, during the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In light of the restatement of our financial statement as disclosed in this Amendment, we plan to enhance our processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to our financial statements. Our plans at this time include providing enhanced access to accounting literature, research materials and documents and increased communication among our personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects.

Compensation Committee The Compensation Committee reviews annually the Company s corporate goals and objectives relevant to the officers compensation, evaluates the officers performance in light of such goals and objectives, determines and approves the officers compensation level based on this evaluation; makes recommendations to the Board regarding approval, disapproval, modification, or termination of existing or proposed employee benefit plans, makes recommendations to the Board with respect to non-CEO and non-CFO compensation and administers the Company s incentive-compensation plans and equity-based plans. The Compensation Committee has the authority to delegate any of its responsibilities to subcommittees as it may deem appropriate in its sole discretion. The chief executive officer of the Company may not be present during voting or deliberations of the Compensation Committee with respect to his compensation. The Company s executive officers do not play a role in suggesting their own salaries. Neither the Company nor the Compensation Committee has engaged any compensation consultant who has a role in determining or recommending the amount or form of executive or director compensation. The Compensation Committee did not meet during 2021. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as indicated above, no compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, including our directors, or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of a business combination. Accordingly, it is likely that prior to the consummation of an initial business combination, the compensation committee will only be responsible for the review and recommendation of any compensation arrangements to be entered into in connection with such initial business combination. The members of the Compensation Committee are Trevor A. Edwards, Jay Margolis, and Ruma Bose, each of whom is an independent director under Nasdaq s listing standards. Mr. Margolis is the Chairperson of the Compensation Committee. Conflicts of Interest Investors should be aware of the following potential conflicts of interest: None of our officers and directors is required to commit their full time to our affairs and, accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time among various business activities. In the course of their other business activities, our officers and directors may become aware of investment and business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to our company as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated. Our management has pre-existing fiduciary duties and contractual obligations and may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. Our officers and directors may in the future become affiliated with entities, including other blank check companies, engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by our company. The insider shares owned by our officers and directors will be released from escrow only if a business combination is successfully completed and subject to certain other limitations. Additionally, our officers and directors will not receive distributions from the trust account with respect to any of their insider shares if we do not complete a business combination. In addition, our officers and directors may loan funds to us after the IPO and may be owed reimbursement for expenses incurred in connection with certain activities on our behalf which would only be repaid if we complete an initial business combination. For the foregoing reasons, the personal and financial interests of our directors and executive officers may influence their

 motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, completing a business combination in a timely manner and securing the release of their shares. 
 In general, officers and directors of a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware are required to present business opportunities to a corporation if: the corporation could financially undertake the opportunity; the opportunity is within the corporation s line of business; and it would not be fair to the corporation and its stockholders for the opportunity not to be brought to the attention of the corporation. 
 In addition, when exercising powers or performing duties as a director, the director is required to exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonable director would exercise in the same circumstances taking into account, without limitation the nature of the company, the nature of the decision and the position of the director and the nature of the responsibilities undertaken by him. A director need not exhibit in the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his knowledge and experience. As set out above, directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position of conflict and this includes a duty not to engage in self-dealing, or to otherwise benefit as a result of their position. However, in some instances what would otherwise be a breach of this duty can be forgiven and/or authorized in advance by the stockholders provided that there is full disclosure by the directors. This can be done by way of permission granted in the memorandum and articles of association or alternatively by stockholder approval at general meetings. A director shall, forthwith after becoming aware of the fact that he is interested in a transaction entered into or to be entered into by the company, disclose the interest to the board of the company. As set out above, directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position of conflict and this includes a duty not to engage in self-dealing, or to otherwise benefit as a result of their position. However, in some instances what would otherwise be a breach of this duty can be forgiven and/or authorized in advance by the stockholders provided that there is full disclosure by the directors. This can be done by way of permission granted in the memorandum and articles of association or alternatively by stockholder approval at general meetings. Accordingly, as a result of multiple business affiliations, our officers and directors may have similar legal obligations relating to presenting business opportunities meeting the above-listed criteria to multiple entities. In addition, conflicts of interest may arise when our board evaluates a particular business opportunity with respect to the above-listed criteria. We cannot assure you that any of the above mentioned conflicts will be resolved in our favor. Furthermore, most of our officers and directors have pre-existing fiduciary obligations to other businesses of which they are officers or directors. To the extent they identify business opportunities which may be suitable for the entities to which they owe pre-existing fiduciary obligations, our officers and directors will honor those fiduciary obligations. Accordingly, it is possible they may not present opportunities to us that otherwise may be attractive to us unless the entities to which they owe pre-existing fiduciary obligations and any successors to such entities have declined to accept such opportunities. In order to minimize potential conflicts of interest which may arise from multiple corporate affiliations, each of our officers and directors has contractually agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, until the earliest of a business combination, our liquidation or such time as he ceases to be an officer or director, to present to our company for our consideration, prior to presentation to any other entity, any suitable business opportunity which may reasonably be required to be presented to us, subject to any pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations he might have.

Specialty Finance Director Lovepop, Inc. Consumer Products Director In connection with the vote required for any business combination, all of our existing stockholders, including all of our officers and directors, have agreed to vote their respective insider shares in favor of any proposed business combination. In addition, they have agreed to waive their respective rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to those shares of common stock acquired by them prior to the IPO. If they purchased shares of common stock in the IPO or in the open market, however, they would be entitled to participate in any liquidation distribution in respect of such shares but have agreed not to convert such shares (or sell their shares in any tender offer) in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination or an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to pre-business combination activity. All ongoing and future transactions between us and any of our officers and directors or their respective affiliates will be on terms believed by us to be no less favorable to us than are available from unaffiliated third parties. Such transactions will require prior approval by our audit committee and a majority of our uninterested independent directors, or the members of our board who do not have an interest in the transaction, in either case who had access, at our expense, to our attorneys or independent legal counsel. We will not enter into any such transaction unless our audit committee and a majority of our disinterested independent directors determine that the terms of such transaction are no less favorable to us than those that would be available to us with respect to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties. To further minimize conflicts of interest, we have agreed not to consummate our initial business combination with an entity that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or initial stockholders, unless we have obtained (i) an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view and (ii) the approval of a majority of our disinterested and independent directors (if we have any at that time). Furthermore, in no event will any of our initial stockholders, officers, directors, special advisors or their respective affiliates be paid any finder s fee, consulting fee or other similar compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination. Code of Ethics We adopted a code of conduct and ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. The code of ethics codifies the business and ethical principles that govern all aspects of our business. Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, requires our executive officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10 of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our shares of common stock and other equity securities. These executive officers, directors, and greater than 10 beneficial owners are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms filed by such reporting persons. Based solely on our review of such forms furnished to us and written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that all filing requirements applicable to our executive officers, directors and greater than 10 beneficial owners were filed in a timely manner.

 Item 11. Executive Compensation. Employment Agreements We have not entered into any employment agreements with our executive officers and have not made any agreements to provide benefits upon termination of employment. Executive Officers and Director Compensation No executive officer has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. No compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, including our directors, or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of a business combination. However, such individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. There is no limit on the amount of these out-of-pocket expenses and there will be no review of the reasonableness of the expenses by anyone other than our board of directors and audit committee, which includes persons who may seek reimbursement, or a court of competent jurisdiction if such reimbursement is challenged. Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. The following table sets forth as of March 31, 2022 the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by (i) each person who is known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock (ii) each of our officers and directors; and (iii) all of our officers and directors as a group. As of March 31, 2021, we had 5,360,800 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.

 The founder shares, private placement shares and any shares of common stock issued upon conversion thereof are each subject to transfer restrictions pursuant to lock-up provisions in a letter agreement with us to be entered into by our sponsor, officers and directors. Those lock-up provisions provide that such securities are not transferable or salable (i) in the case of the founder shares, until the earlier of (A) one year after the completion of our initial business combination or (B) subsequent to our initial business combination, (x) if the last reported sale price of our common stock equals or exceeds 12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination, or (y) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of our stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property, and (ii) in the case of the private placement shares, until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination, except in each case (a) to our officers or directors, any affiliates or family members of any of our officers or directors, any members of our sponsor, or any affiliates of our sponsor; (b) in the case of an individual, by gift to a member of the individual s immediate family or to a trust, the beneficiary of which is a member of the individual s immediate family, an affiliate of such person or to a charitable organization; (c) in the case of an individual, by virtue of laws of descent and distribution upon death of the individual; (d) in the case of an individual, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order; (e) by private sales or transfers made in connection with the consummation of an initial business combination at prices no greater than the price at which the shares were originally purchased; (f) in the event of our liquidation prior to the completion of our initial business combination; or (g) by virtue of the laws of Delaware or our sponsor s limited liability company agreement upon dissolution of our sponsor, provided, however, that in the case of clauses (a) through (e) or (g), these permitted transferees must enter into a written agreement agreeing to be bound by these transfer restrictions and the other restrictions contained in the letter agreements and by the same agreements entered into by our sponsor, officers and directors, as the case may be, with respect to such securities. Our initial stockholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion Working Capital Loans ). Each Working Capital Loan would be evidenced by a promissory note.. If the Sponsor makes any Working Capital Loans, such loans may be converted into shares of Class A Common Stock, at the price of 10.00 per share at the option of the lender. If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds held in the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination is not completed, the Company may use a portion of the proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender s discretion, up to 1,000,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock at a price of 10.00 per share. Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. Founder Shares On February 3, 2021, our founder acquired 5,031,250 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of 25,000, or approximately 0.005 per share. The founder shares include an aggregate of up to 562,500 shares subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriter s over-allotment is not exercised in full or in part, so that our sponsor will own 20 of the Company s issued and outstanding shares upon the completion of our initial public offering. On June 8 2021, our sponsor surrendered 861,250 founder shares for no consideration. On June 16, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option to purchase an additional 1,680,000 shares. On July 26, 2021, 142,500 founder shares were forfeited upon the expiration of the underwriters over-allotment option, resulting in an aggregate of 4,170,000 founder shares outstanding. Private Placement Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 1,090,000 private placement shares at a price of 10.00 per private placement share, generating gross proceeds of 10,900,000. On June 16, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment option and purchased an additional 100,800 over-allotment private placement shares at a price of 10.00 per share, generating gross proceeds of 1,008,000. The proceeds from the sale of the private placement shares and over-allotment private placement shares were added to the net proceeds from the initial public offering held in the trust account.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Iron Spark I Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Iron Spark I Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2021, the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit and cash flows for the period from January 22, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from January 22, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Restatement of 2021 Financial Statements As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the accompanying financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and for the period from January 22, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, have been restated. Explanatory Paragraph Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company s business plan is dependent on the completion of a business combination and the Company s cash and working capital as of December 31, 2021 are not sufficient to complete its planned activities. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Marcum LLP Marcum LLP We have served as the Company s auditor since 2021. New York, NY March 31, 2022, except for the effects of the restatement discussed in Note 2, as to which the date is September 30, 2022.

If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 6) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the initial transaction or do not vote at all. Notwithstanding the above, if the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company.

In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) per Public Share or (ii) such lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay the Company s tax obligation and up to for liquidation excepts, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account (even if such waiver is deemed to be unenforceable) and except as to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Management plans to address this uncertainty through the Business Combination as discussed above. There is no assurance that the Company s plans to consummate the Business Combination will be successful or successful within the Combination Period. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Risks and Uncertainties Management continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company s financial position, results of its operations, and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 The Company utilized a Modified Black-Scholes simulation model to value the over-allotment option at initial measurement, upon partial exercise of the over-allotment option, and each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations. The estimated fair value of the over-allotment options are determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a binomial options pricing model are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its ordinary shares based on historical volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the over-allotment option. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the over-allotment option. The expected life of the over-allotment option is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates to remain at zero. The following table provides the significant inputs to the Black-Scholes simulation for the fair value of the over-allotment option: Exercise price Dividend yield Expected term (in years) Volatility Risk-free rate Fair value of over-allotment options
