SCORES HOLDING CO., Inc. and Subsidiary 

 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

 (Unaudited) 

Note 1. Organization 

BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

Scores Holding Company, Inc. (the Company is a Utah corporation, formed in September 1981 and located in New York, NY. Originally incorporated as Adonis Energy, Inc.,
the Company adopted its current name in July 2002. The Company is a licensing company that utilizes the SCORES name
and trademark for licensing options. 

The consolidated financial statements of the
Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S.
GAAP ). The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of Scores Licensing Corp. SLC ), its wholly-owned subsidiary. 

The Company's condensed consolidated financial
statements include the Company's accounts, as well as those of its wholly-owned subsidiary. Certain prior period amounts have
been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The Company's accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q
and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnote disclosures required
by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments considered
necessary for a fair presentation of the condensed consolidated results of operations and financial position for the interim periods
presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. These unaudited condensed interim consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial
statements contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The results of operations for the
nine months ended September 30, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other interim period or
for the year ending December 31, 2019. 

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Principles 

Going Concern 

As of September 30, 2019, the Company has
cumulative losses totaling (6,818,368) and negative working capital of 107,887. The Company had a net income of 75,825 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2019. Because of these conditions, the Company will require additional working capital to develop business
operations. The Company intends to raise additional working capital through the continued licensing of its brand with its current and
new operators. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to achieve the level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient
cash flow from operations to support the Company s working capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated from any future
use of licensing are insufficient, the Company will have to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be given that additional
financing will be available, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If adequate working capital is not available,
the Company may not continue its operations. 

These conditions raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern.

 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

 (Unaudited) 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

The Company earns royalty revenues from ten licensees. 

With regards to September 30, 2019, concentrations
of sales from four licensees range from 10 to 30 , totaling 78 . There are receivables from two licensees ranging from 14 to 76 , totaling
90 . There are no sales from licensees that are considered related parties. There are no receivables from these licensees that are considered
related parties. 

With regards to September 30, 2018, concentrations
of sales from four licensees range from 11 to24 , totaling 70 . There are receivables from three licensees ranging from 16 to 33 totaling
77 . . There are no sales from licensees that are considered related parties. There are no receivables from these licensees that are
considered related parties. 

Principles of consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary. Inter-company items and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Cash and cash equivalents 

The Company considers all highly liquid temporary
cash investments, with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, to be cash equivalents. There are times when cash may exceed
 250,000, the FDIC insured limit. 

Income per Share 

Under ASC 260-10-45,
 Earnings Per Share , basic income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the income (loss) applicable to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares assumed to be outstanding during the period of computation. Diluted income
(loss) per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding
during the period. Accordingly, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the periods ended September 30, 2019
and 2018, respectively, is the same for purposes of computing both basic and diluted net income per share for such years. As of September 30,
2019, there are no outstanding stock equivalents. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The carrying value of cash and accrued expenses,
if applicable, approximate their fair values based on the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying amounts of debt were
also estimated to approximate fair value. 

The Company utilizes the methods of fair value
measurement as described in ASC 820 to value its financial assets and liabilities. As defined in ASC 820, fair value is based on the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date. In order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, ASC 820 establishes a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels, which are described
below: 

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to
Level 1 inputs. 

Level 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted
on active markets, but corroborated by market data. 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs are used when
little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards Update 

Leases 

In
March 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842): Codification Improvements. ASU 2019-01 aligns the guidance
for fair value of the underlying asset by lessors with existing guidance in Topic 842. The ASU requires that the fair value of the underlying
asset at lease commencement is its cost reflecting in volume or trade discounts that may apply. However, if there has been a significant
lapse of time between the date the asset was acquired and the lease commencement date, the definition of fair value as outlined in Topic
820 should be applied. In addition, the ASU exempts both lessees and lessors from having to provide certain interim disclosures in the
fiscal year in which a company adopts the new leases standard. The update is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those
fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. We are still evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company s consolidated
financial statements . 

All new accounting pronouncements issued but
not yet effective or adopted have been deemed not to be relevant to us, hence are not expected to have any impact once adopted. 

Note 3. Revenue Recognition 

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Topic 606, Revenue from Contacts with Customers ASC 606 ). ASC
606 was applied using the modified retrospective method. Accordingly, comparative periods have not been adjusted and continue to be reported
under FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition ASC 605 ). There was a cumulative effect of 71,000 to be recognized as an
adjustment to opening retained earnings at January 1, 2018 related to deferred revenue booked from initiation fees that were received
in prior years of 49,750 that would have been recognized at a point in time and revenues that would be recognized on the accrual basis
in the prior years based on collection probability assessment of 21,250. Under ASC 605, initiation fee revenue was to be deferred and
recognized over the life of the contract while most royalty revenues were recognized as collected. However, under ASC 606, revenue from
the initiation fees are recognizable when at a point in time (first month of the contract) and royalty revenues are recognized over time
for those contracts with probable collections. 

The Company's license fee revenue is generated
from royalties earned through intellectual property licensing agreements which permit the licensee to use the recognition and status
of the Scores brand in order to promote their businesses. Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized throughout the life of the executed licensing
agreement. The Company measures revenue based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer. Furthermore, the Company recognizes
revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over the service to its customer. 

A performance obligation is a promise in a contract
to transfer a distinct service to the customer. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation
and recognized as revenue when or as the customer receives the benefit of the performance obligation. The Company's customers typically
receive the benefit of its services as they are performed. Substantially all customer contracts provide that the Company is compensated
for services performed to date. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing
transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue. 

Nature of goods and services 

The following is a description of the Company's
products and services from which it generates revenue, as well as the nature, timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and
significant payment terms for each: 

i. Licensing Revenue 

Licensing fees represent the fees the Company
receives from the licensing of the Company's Scores trademark. The terms of the royalties earned under these license agreements vary
from a flat monthly fee to a percentage of the revenues of the licensee on a monthly basis. The licensing rights are transferred to the
Company's customers over time, and the Company recognizes licensing revenue over time because the customer will simultaneously receive
and consume the benefit from the license as the performance occurs.

who formerly performed as an adult entertainer at Scores New York, owned in its entirety by I.M. Operating LLC, commenced a putative
class action lawsuit against the Company, IMO, Robert Gans and Mark Yackow in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County
of New York. Plaintiff alleged that she and other similarly situated entertainers at Scores New York were misclassified as independent
contractors, that they should have been classified as employees, and as a result, the Defendants violated, among other things, applicable
state wage and hour laws. The Lawsuit sought unspecified compensatory damages, liquidated damages, as well as attorneys fees and
costs. On June 22, 2018, Plaintiff (1) amended her complaint in the Lawsuit to excise her class allegations, and (2) discontinued

and Recordkeeping requirements of the NYLL; violated the wage statement provisions of the NYLL; recovery of equipment costs in violation
of the FLSA and NYLL; and unlawful deductions from tips in violation of the NYLL. Plaintiff brought this action as a class action and
seeks certification of this action as a collective action on behalf of herself and all other similarly situated employees and former
employees of Defendants. The Company has submitted an Answer to Plaintiff s claims and the case is currently in the discovery phase.

more than 25 hours per week. The case was assigned to a Magistrate Judge. There was a conference on March 2, 2021 and
a Scheduling Order was entered. All discovery is due by May 27, 2021.

of SCORES New Orleans, for unpaid royalties in the amount of 145,500. Defendant was served on September 19, 2018 and the parties
are in the process of negotiating a settlement agreement. 

On
July 13, 2018, the Company together with its subsidiary SLC filed a civil action in Supreme Court of New York, New York County against
Manhattan Fashions LLC, the licensee of SCORES Harvey for unpaid royalties in the amount of 102,984. A default judgement for this amount
was entered and filed on December 7, 2020. We are working on entering the judgment in Louisiana, but the parties are
participating in ongoing negotiations to settle this matter. 

On September 5, 2019, the Company together
with its subsidiary SLC filed a civil action in Supreme Court of New York, New York County against Scores Alabama. A cease and desist
letter was sent. The Company finally entered into a license agreement as of March 5, 2020 with Cheetah Club, LLC for a club located
in Huntsville, Alabama. 

On July 15, 2019, plaintiff Jeremy Green, a former
consultant to Swan Media Group, Inc SMG ), commenced an action in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York against
Scores Holding Co., Inc., Scores Media Group LLC, Scores Digital Gaming LLC SDG and individual defendants Robert Gans
and Charilaos Yioves seeking to recover from all defendants under various theories of breach of contract, unjust enrichment, promissory
estoppels, fraudulent inducement and breach of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. 

By Order dated March 18, 2020 the Court dismissed
all the causes of action except for the breach of contract claim pertaining to Greene s consultancy agreement with SMG and the unjust
enrichment claim relating to SDG. The parties have exchanged documents and information relating to the remaining cause of action. Depositions
were held in early November, 2021. As a result certain additional documents have been requested by plaintiff s counsel and are currently
being assembled for submission. If the case is not disposed on motion, pre-trial documents are scheduled to be exchanged in the near future. 

In
2020 Jessica Hall filed an EEOC against the Company. In 2021, the case Jessica Hall v. Scores Holding Company, Inc., et al was filed in
Federal Court, Southern District. Scores Holding Company was not properly served with the Complaint. There is a pending motion
for default judgment, which we plan to oppose. Plaintiff claims that she worked at a gentlemen s club known as Scores
NY where she, inter alia , was discriminated and retaliated against in violation of both Federal and State law. The
likelihood of success on the merits is slim to none because Scores Holding Company, as simply the owner of the Scores brand
and trademarks, did not own Scores NY or employ, manage or otherwise control Plaintiff s employment.

In July 2018, the Company entered into a
confidential settlement agreement (the Settlement Agreement in the Voronina litigation, and in August 2018, the Court
entered an order dismissing the plaintiff s claims against the Defendants with prejudice. Metropolitan, loaned the Company an aggregate
of 770,000 to enable the Company to make the payments called for by the Agreement. 

As previously reported, in February 2017,
the Company entered into settlement agreements (each, a Royalty Settlement Agreement with Star Light, Swan, IMO and
Robert M. Gans. Robert M. Gans is the owner of a majority of the equity of each of aforementioned Licensees. Pursuant to the Royalty
Settlement Agreements, the Company forgave the repayment of a certain portion of unpaid, past-due royalties in return for the respective
Licensees agreements to pay the remainder (the Royalty Settlement Amount of the unpaid royalties, plus interest,
to the Company. The Royalty Settlement Amount for each Licensee was represented by a promissory note, and Robert M. Gans guaranteed the
payment of each Licensee s obligations under the Settlement Agreement. 

The Licensees did not remain current with respect
to their obligations under the Royalty Settlement Agreements, and the Company did not call upon Robert M. Gans to honor his guarantees.
The past due amounts under the Royalty Settlement Agreements aggregated 382,259 (the Aggregate Royalty Amount as of December 1,
2018. As of such date, the Company, the Licensees, Metropolitan and Robert M. Gans entered into a Settlement and Offset Agreement (the
 Offset Agreement pursuant to which the Aggregate Royalty Amount was offset against the Voronina Amount, thereby reducing
the amount owed by the Company to Metropolitan to 408,546 (the Net Voronina Amount ). The Net Voronina Amount is payable
pursuant to a promissory note (the Voronina Note ), which bears simple interest at the rate of 4 per annum, in 86 consecutive
monthly installments of 5,000, and a final installment of 1,370, with the initial installment due and payable on January 1, 2022
(or the first business day thereafter). The Company may prepay the Voronina Note at any time, in whole or in part without premium or
penalty. The Offset Agreement also provides for the immediate termination of the Royalty Settlement Agreements and the related promissory
notes and guarantees. 

On
January 29, 2020, an individual referred to as Jane Doe, the Plaintiff, filed a civil suit in in the Circuit Court of
the 13 th Judicial Circuit, in the State of Florida, Hillsborough County, against the Company, its subsidiary, Scores
Licensing Corp. SLC ), and several other defendants. Plaintiff s Complaint details the somber circumstances
surround the illegal actions of a non-party, who pled guilty to certain crimes against Plaintiff that were committed at a club known
as Scores Tampa. Plaintiff now seeks to hold the Company and its subsidiary, among other defendants, liable in connection with
the non-party s illegal activity by asserting causes of action for negligence, vicarious liability and unjust enrichment. 
Initially, prior counsel moved to dismiss Plaintiff s Complaint in lieu of filing Answers. A motion to dismiss was submitted
because the Court lacks personal jurisdiction under Florida s Long-Arm Statute and Due Process Requirements because neither the
Company or its subsidiary had minimum contacts with Florida; nor was their a benefited conferred upon them. The Court wrongfully
denied the motion to dismiss. The case is in the deposition stage of discovery. A motion for summary judgment will be
submitted because neither the Company or its subsidiary were involved in the day-to-day operations of Scores Tampa, or in fact involved
in the operations of Scores Tampa at all. Other than the Company licensing the Scores trademark and other intellectual property
to Scores Tampa, pursuant to a 2010 license agreement, neither the Company or its affiliate operated, conducted, engaged in, or managed
Scores Tampa, making it vicariously liable for the non-party s criminal actions. 

On July 15,
2019, plaintiff Jeremy Green, a former consultant to Swan Media Group, Inc SMG ), commenced an action in U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York against Scores Holding Co., Inc., Scores Media Group LLC, Scores Digital Gaming LLC SDG and individual defendants Robert Gans and Charilaos Yioves seeking to recover from all defendants under various theories of breach of
contract, unjust enrichment, promissory estoppels, fraudulent inducement and breach of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. 

By Order
dated March 18, 2020 the Court dismissed all the causes of action except for the breach of contract claim pertaining to Greene s
consultancy agreement with SMG and the unjust enrichment claim relating to SDG. The parties have exchanged documents and information
relating to the remaining causes of acting and depositions are scheduled to be held in early May, 2021. The parties expect fact discovery
will be concluded by June 2021 and expert disclosures, if necessary, shall be completed by August 31, 2021. If the case is
not disposed on motion, pre-trial documents are scheduled to be exchanged in September, 2021.

Note 8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

Please see Note 7 for events concerning legal
matters. 

Management evaluated
subsequent events through the date of this filing and determined that no additional events have occurred that would require adjustment
to or disclosure in the financial statements. 

As a result of the COVID-19 virus, during the
first quarter of 2020 and ongoing, state and local governments have required all but certain essential businesses to close, including
all nine clubs operating under the Scores name. The duration and ultimate extent of the closures of these clubs cannot be predicted at
this time, however the impact on such clubs' revenue could be material and result in a significant decline in our royalty revenues.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

Overview 

Scores Holding Company, Inc. Scores, the Company, we, us or our was incorporated in Utah on
September 21, 1981 under the name Adonis Energy, Inc. We adopted our current name in July 2002. Since 2003, we have been
in the business of licensing the Scores trademarks and other intellectual property to fine gentlemen s nightclubs
with adult entertainment in the United States. As of September 30, 2019, there are nine such clubs operating under the Scores name,
in New York, New York; Chicago, Illinois; Tampa, Florida; New Orleans, Louisiana; Harvey, Louisiana; Mooresville, North Carolina;
Palm Springs, Florida; Buffalo, New York and Las Vegas, Nevada. 

On January 27, 2009,
Mitchell s East LLC, wholly owned by Robert M. Gans, acquired a majority interest in our outstanding capital stock. I.M. Operating
LLC IMO ), which is partially owned by Robert M. Gans who is also our majority shareholder, has signed a licensing agreement
with us and commenced operations in New York of a new club (the New York Club under the Scores name in May 2009. Effective
September 1, 2017, IMO no longer owned or operated the New York Club and terminated its licensing agreement with the Company.
IMO sold the New York Club to Club Azure LLC CA which was owned by Mark Yackow who is the sole owner (100 of CA and
former Chief Operating Officer of IMO. Mr. Yackow passed away on October 12, 2020. Effective September 1, 2017, the Company
granted an exclusive, non-transferable license for the use of the Scores New York to CA for the New York Club. 

As a result of the COVID-19
virus, during the first and second quarter of 2020, state and local governments have required all but certain essential businesses to
close, including all nine clubs operating under the Scores name. The duration and ultimate extent of the closures of these clubs cannot
be predicted at this time, however the impact on such clubs' revenue could be material and result in a significant decline in our royalty
revenues. 

Results of Operations 

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2019 the 2019 three-month period Compared to Three Months Ended September 30,
2018 the 2018 three-month period ). 

Revenues: 

Revenues decreased to 174,124
for the 2019 three-month period from 234,489 for the 2018 three-month period. 

Our licenses are structured
such that we receive royalty payments representing a percentage of revenues of the licensee, or structured with a flat monthly rate. The
foregoing decrease is a direct result of a decline in royalty revenues. This decrease is primarily due to the decrease in the number of
licensing agreements for the three months ended September 30, 2018 from twelve agreements to ten agreements for the three months
September 30, 2019. 

Other Income 

Total other income decreased
to 11,092 for the 2019 three-month period from 567,095 from the 2018 three-month period. Total other income for the 2019 three month-period
included a 5,000 recovery of the 1,300,000 Litigation Settlement payment paid to us by various licensees, interest expense of 3,098,
and other income of 10,000 representing a recovery of royalty revenue previously written off as bad debt and collected during the 2019
three-month period. Total other income for the 2018 three-month period included a 325,660 recovery of the 1,300,000 Litigation Settlement

General and Administrative
Expenses: 

General
and administrative expenses decreased during the 2019 three-month period to 159,954 from 209,636 during the 2018 three-month period,
which can be attributed to the decrease in salary, consulting, advertising, and other expenses. Legal expenses, which are reflected in
general and administrative expenses, attribute to ongoing litigation in the amount of 30,785 for the 2019 three-month period and 59,561
for the 2018 three-month period. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

The provision for income taxes
relates primarily to the greater of average assets and capital taxable income. The average assets and capital are not impacted by net
operating losses. 

Net Income: 

Our net income was 25,262
or .00 per share for the 2019 three-month period as compared to net income of 591,934 or .00 per share for the 2018 three-month period. 

Net income per share data
for both the 2019 three-month period and the 2018 three-month period is based on net income available to common shareholders divided by
the weighted average of the number of common shares outstanding. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 (the
 2019 nine-month period Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 (the 2018 nine-month period ). 

Revenues: 

Revenues decreased to 439,971
for the 2019 nine-month period from 629,564 for the 2018 nine-month period. 

Our licenses are structured
such that we receive royalty payments representing a percentage of revenues of the licensee, or structured with a flat monthly rate. The
foregoing decrease is a direct result of a decline in royalty revenues. This decrease is primarily due to the decrease in the number of
licensing agreements as of September 30, 2018 from twelve agreements to ten agreements as of September 30, 2019. 

Other Income 

Total other income increased
to 116,269 for the 2019 nine-month period from total other expense of 698,535 for the 2018 nine-month period. Total other income for
the 2019 nine month-period included a 90,000 recovery of the 1,300,000 Litigation Settlement payment paid to us by various licensees,

General and Administrative
Expenses: 

General
and administrative expenses decreased slightly during the 2019 nine-month period to 480,415 from 567,940 during the 2018 nine-month
period, which can be attributed to the decrease in salary, legal and other expenses. Legal expenses, which are reflected in general and
administrative expenses, attributable to ongoing litigation amounted to 91,273 for the 2019 nine-month period and 121,822 for
the 2018 nine-month period. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

The provision for income taxes
relates primarily to the greater of average assets and capital taxable income. The average assets and capital are not impacted by net
operating losses.

Net Income/(Loss): 

Our net income was 75,825
or .00 per share for the 2019 nine-month period as compared to net loss of 638,801 or .00) per share for the 2018 nine-month period.
This decrease was primarily due to the litigation settlement fees of 1,300,000 in the 2018 nine-month period. 

Net income/(loss) per share
data for both the 2019 nine-month period and the 2018 nine-month period is based on net income/(loss) available to common shareholders
divided by the weighted average of the number of common shares outstanding. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Going
Concern : 

Various conditions such as the accumulated losses, significant debt, and the results of litigation raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might
be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Cash: 

At September 30, 2019,
we had 17,143 in cash and cash equivalents compared to 7,662 in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018. 

Operating Activities: 

Net cash provided by operating
activities for the 2019 nine-month period was 90,273 and net cash used by operating activities for the 2018 nine-month period was 479,244.
The increase in cash provided by operating activities is related to the recognition of ASC 606 revenue and the accrued litigation settlement
in the 2018 nine-month period. 

Financing Activities: 

Net cash used by financing
activities for the 2019 nine-month period was 80,792 and net cash provided by financing activities for the 2018 nine-month period was
 459,139. 

As of September 30, 2019
and 2018, we owed 7,500 and 22,500, respectively in rent to our Westside Realty affiliate. As of September 30, 2019 and 2018, we
owed to our Metropolitan Lumber Hardware and Building Supplies, Inc. affiliate 45,000 and 67,500, respectively for management fees
and 342,178 and 0, respectively for a loan advanced to the Company to assist in paying litigation costs. 

Future Capital Requirements: 

We have incurred significant
losses since the inception of our business. Since our inception, we have been dependent on funding from private lenders and investors
to conduct operations. As of September 30, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of (6,818,368). As of September 30, 2019, we
had total current assets of 140,710 and total current liabilities of 248,597 or negative working capital of 107,887. As of December 31,
2018, we had total current assets of 73,576 and total current liabilities of 231,496 or negative working capital of 157,920. The decrease
in the amount of negative working capital has been primarily attributable to the increase in cash from previous non-paying clubs. 

We will continue to evaluate
possible acquisitions of or investments in businesses, products and technologies that are complementary to ours. These may require the
use of cash, which would require us to seek financing. We may sell equity or debt securities or seek credit facilities to fund acquisition-related
or other business costs. Sales of equity or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders. We may
also need to raise additional funds in order to support more rapid expansion, develop new or enhanced services or products, respond to
competitive pressures, or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities. Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon
numerous factors, including the success of our adult entertainment trademark licensing business.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES. 

(a) Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Based on management s
evaluation (with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer), as of September 30, 2019, the
end of the period covered by this report, our CEO and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure of controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act )), are not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2019 because of the deficiencies in our internal control
over financial reporting relating to the effectiveness and timeliness of our financial statement review process, including policies and
procedures governing our financial statement close process, and control in the preparation, documentation, and review of journal entries
and account reconciliations 

A deficiency in internal
control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the
normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a
deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. The control deficiencies as of September 30, 2019, and subsequent reports should be considered material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. 

As set forth below, management
has taken or will take steps to remediate the control deficiencies identified above. Notwithstanding the control deficiencies described
above, we have performed additional analyses and other procedures to enable management to conclude that our condensed consolidated financial
statements included in this Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition and results of operations
as of and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019. 

Management's Remediation Plan 

In response to the deficiencies
discussed above, we plan to continue efforts already underway to improve internal control over financial reporting, which include creating
formal policies and procedures governing our financial statement close process, and control in the preparation, documentation, and review
of journal entries and account reconciliations. 

Management and our Board of
Directors will continue to monitor these remedial measures and the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures. Other than as
described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2019
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS. 

On April 3, 2016, 50
individuals purporting to be professional models and/or actresses collectively, the Plaintiffs filed a civil suit in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, I.M. Operating, LLC, The Executive Club,
LLC, and Robert M. Gans, collectively the Defendants alleging that images of Plaintiffs were used without their consent
for commercial purposes on websites and social media outlets to promote gentlemen s clubs operated by the Defendants or licensees
of the Defendants (the Lawsuit ). The Lawsuit further alleged that the unauthorized use of these images created, among other
things, the false impression that these individuals either worked at, or endorsed, one or more of such clubs. The Lawsuit asserted causes
of action under Section 43 of the Lanham Act, 28 U.S.C. 1125(a)(1), premised on a theory of false endorsement and/or association;
New York Civil Rights Law 50-51; New York s Deceptive Trade Practices Act, New York General Business Law 349;
as well as various common law torts, namely defamation, negligence, conversion, unjust enrichment and quantum meruit. The Lawsuit sought
unspecified compensatory damages, punitive damages, as well as attorneys fees and costs. The Lawsuit also sought an injunction
permanently enjoining the use of the individuals images to promote, via any medium, any of the clubs. On April 20, 2017, as
a result of the claims asserted in the Lawsuit, the Company filed a third-party complaint (the Third-Party Complaint against
certain licensees, namely CG Consulting, LLC; Anthony Quaranta; High Five Management Group, Inc.; Club 2000 Eastern Avenue, Inc.;
SCMD, LLC; David Baucom; Manhattan Fashion L.L.C.; Stone Park Entertainment, Inc.; Silver Bourbon, Inc.; Tampa Food

Defendants respective license agreements, each of the Third-Party Defendants are expressly obligated to indemnify, defend and hold
the Company harmless in connection with the conduct giving rise to the claims asserted by Plaintiffs in the Lawsuit. Third-Party Defendants
Club 2000 Eastern Avenue, Inc., Fuun House Productions, L.L.C., and Norm A Properties, LLC (collectively the Defaulting Third-Party
Defendants failed to respond to the Third-Party Complaint. 

On January 5, 2017, the
Court issued an Order granting in part, and denying in part, Defendants motion to dismiss the Complaint. The Court dismissed Plaintiffs 
claims sounding in negligence, conversion, unjust enrichment and quantum meruit. The remaining claims were not dismissed at that time.
On August 4, 2018, the Court dismissed Plaintiffs claims against Defendants, including the Company, with prejudice, at Plaintiffs 
request following settlement with Defendants. During 2018, the Company paid 1,310,000 to Plaintiffs in connection with the settlement.
Between August 4, 2018 and October 9, 2018, the Court dismissed with prejudice the Company s claims against the Third-Party
Defendants, other than the Defaulting Third-Party Defendants, at the Company s request following settlement with those Third-Party
Defendants. The total amount of money paid to the Company by the settling Third-Party Defendants, and the Company s insurance carrier,
is 505,660, which includes 325,660 paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Scores has obtained Default Orders against
Fuun House Productions, L.L.C. and Norm A Properties, LLC. The value of the Company s claims against Fuun House Productions, L.L.C.
and Norm A Properties, LLC are all that remain to be determined in the action. The Company became aware during the week of December 17,
2018 that Fuun House Productions, L.L.C. has filed for bankruptcy protection. 

On January 3, 2017, the
Company, together with its subsidiary SLC, filed an action against CJ NYC Inc. in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York. Defendant utilizes the Scores name and trademark in connection with its ownership and operation of an adult
entertainment club in Woodside, New York. In this action the Company sought damages for breach of contract in the amount of 85,000 and
the issuance of a preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting the defendant from using the Scores name and trademark
with respect to the Woodside, New York club and all websites and social media sites controlled by Defendant. The defendant failed to appear
and on February 27, 2017, the Company filed a motion for judgment by default. The court heard the Company motion on April 5,
2017, and on May 25, 2017, the court granted the Company's motion for a Judgment by default, granting a permanent injunction and
awarding damages in the amount of 85,000 to SLC and 14,333 in damages and 530 in costs to the Company. All signage has been removed
and the Company is attempting to collect on the default judgment, but it believes that Defendant no longer has any assets, leaving the
Company unable to collect on the default judgment.

On January 31, 2017,
the Company, together with its subsidiary SLC, filed an action against Funn House Productions LLC in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York. Defendant utilizes the Scores name and trademark in connection with its ownership
and operation of an adult entertainment club in New Haven, Connecticut. In this action the Company sought damages for breach of contract
in the amount of 45,000 and the issuance of a preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting the defendant from using the Scores 
name and trademark with respect to the New Haven, Connecticut club and all websites and social media sites controlled by Defendant. The
Defendant failed to appear and on February 28, 2017, the Court granted Plaintiffs motion for a Judgment by default, granting
a permanent injunction and awarding damages in the amount of 60,000. The parties negotiated a settlement agreement, which included a
payment schedule, but then Defendant did not sign the proposed settlement agreement. The Company is attempting to collect on the default
judgment, but it believes that Defendant no longer has any assets, leaving the Company unable to collect on the default judgment. 

On July 25, 2017, plaintiff
Dislenia Munoz, who formerly performed as an adult entertainer at Scores New York, owned in its entirety by I.M. Operating LLC, commenced
a putative class action lawsuit against the Company, IMO, Robert Gans and Mark Yackow in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York. Plaintiff alleged that she and other similarly situated entertainers at Scores New York were misclassified as independent
contractors, that they should have been classified as employees, and as a result, the Defendants violated, among other things, applicable
state wage and hour laws. The Lawsuit sought unspecified compensatory damages, liquidated damages, as well as attorneys fees and
costs. On June 22, 2018, Plaintiff (1) amended her complaint in the Lawsuit to excise her class allegations, and (2) discontinued
the Lawsuit, without prejudice. Plaintiff has brought her claims in the Lawsuit in another forum against the Defendants, other than the
Company, which is no longer a subject of Plaintiff s claims. 

On October 8, 2018, the
Company was served with a Summons and Complaint in the action entitled Luisa Santos de Oliveira v. Scores Holding Company, Inc.;
Club Azure, LLC; Robert Gans; Mark S. Yackow; Howard Rosenbluth, Docket No. 1:18-cv-06769-GBD, in the United States District Court
of the Southern District. Plaintiff claims that the Defendants violated the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards
Act FLSA ); violated the New York Minimum Wage Act and the overtime provisions of the New York State Labor Law NYLL );
violated the Spread of Hours Wage Order of the New York Commissioner of Labor; violated the Notice and Recordkeeping requirements of the
NYLL; violated the wage statement provisions of the NYLL; recovery of equipment costs in violation of the FLSA and NYLL; and unlawful
deductions from tips in violation of the NYLL. Plaintiff brought this action as a class action and seeks certification of this action
as a collective action on behalf of herself and all other similarly situated employees and former employees of Defendants. We are still
in the discovery phase of the litigation. A court conference was recently adjourned from March 26, 2020 to May 28, 2020
because of COVID 19. 

The Company has submitted
an Answer to Plaintiff s claims and the case is currently in the discovery phase. The Company, along with the Co-defendants, intends
to vigorously defend itself against the claims asserted against it in this lawsuit. The likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is remote
because the Company s records show, inter alia, that the Plaintiff never worked more than 25 hours per week. 

On October 10, 2018,

On September 5, 2019,

A cease and desist letter was sent. The Company finally entered into a license agreement as of March 5, 2020 with Cheetah Club, LLC
for a club located in Huntsville, Alabama. 

On July 15, 2019, plaintiff Jeremy Green, a former
consultant to Swan Media Group, Inc SMG ), commenced an action in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York against
Scores Holding Co., Inc., Scores Media Group LLC, Scores Digital Gaming LLC SDG and individual defendants Robert Gans
and Charilaos Yioves seeking to recover from all defendants under various theories of breach of contract, unjust enrichment, promissory
estoppels, fraudulent inducement and breach of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. 

By Order dated March 18, 2020 the Court dismissed
all the causes of action except for the breach of contract claim pertaining to Greene s consultancy agreement with SMG and the unjust
enrichment claim relating to SDG. The parties have exchanged documents and information relating to the remaining cause of action. Depositions
were held in early November, 2021. As a result certain additional documents have been requested by plaintiff s counsel and are currently
being assembled for submission. If the case is not disposed on motion, pre-trial documents are scheduled to be exchanged in the near future. 

In
2020 Jessica Hall filed an EEOC against the Company. In 2021, the case Jessica Hall v. Scores Holding Company, Inc., et al was filed in
Federal Court, Southern District. Scores Holding Company was not properly served with the Complaint. There is a pending motion
for default judgment, which we plan to oppose. Plaintiff claims that she worked at a gentlemen s club known as Scores
NY where she, inter alia , was discriminated and retaliated against in violation of both Federal and State law. The
likelihood of success on the merits is slim to none because Scores Holding Company, as simply the owner of the Scores brand
and trademarks, did not own Scores NY or employ, manage or otherwise control Plaintiff s employment. 

In July 2018, the Company
entered into a confidential settlement agreement (the Settlement Agreement in the Voronina litigation, and in August 2018,
the Court entered an order dismissing the plaintiff s claims against the Defendants with prejudice. Metropolitan, loaned the Company
an aggregate of 770,000 to enable the Company to make the payments called for by the Agreement. 

As previously reported, in
February 2017, the Company entered into settlement agreements (each, a Royalty Settlement Agreement with Star Light,
Swan, IMO and Robert M. Gans. Robert M. Gans is the owner of a majority of the equity of each of aforementioned Licensees. Pursuant
to the Royalty Settlement Agreements, the Company forgave the repayment of a certain portion of unpaid, past-due royalties in return for
the respective Licensees agreements to pay the remainder (the Royalty Settlement Amount of the unpaid royalties,
plus interest, to the Company. The Royalty Settlement Amount for each Licensee was represented by a promissory note, and Robert M. Gans
guaranteed the payment of each Licensee s obligations under the Settlement Agreement. 

The Licensees did not remain
current with respect to their obligations under the Royalty Settlement Agreements, and the Company did not call upon Robert M. Gans to
honor his guarantees. The past due amounts under the Royalty Settlement Agreements aggregated 382,259 (the Aggregate Royalty Amount as of December 1, 2018. As of such date, the Company, the Licensees, Metropolitan and Robert M. Gans entered into a Settlement and
Offset Agreement (the Offset Agreement pursuant to which the Aggregate Royalty Amount was offset against the Voronina Amount,
thereby reducing the amount owed by the Company to Metropolitan to 408,546 (the Net Voronina Amount ). The Net Voronina
Amount is payable pursuant to a promissory note (the Voronina Note ), which bears simple interest at the rate of 4 per annum,
in 86 consecutive monthly installments of 5,000, and a final installment of 1,370, with the initial installment due and payable on January 1,
2022 (or the first business day thereafter). The Company may prepay the Voronina Note at any time, in whole or in part without premium
or penalty. The Offset Agreement also provides for the immediate termination of the Royalty Settlement Agreements and the related promissory
notes and guarantees.
