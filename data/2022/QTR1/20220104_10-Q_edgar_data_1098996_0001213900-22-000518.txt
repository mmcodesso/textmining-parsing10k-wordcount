1. 
 SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

(a) 
 Description of Business 

Oranco, Inc. (the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 16, 1977. The Company has been in the business of the development of mineral
deposits. During 1983 all activities were abandoned, and the Company had remained inactive until June 29, 2018 when it acquired the business
of Reliant Galaxy International Limited Reliant ). The Company and its subsidiaries (the Group are principally
engaged in marketing and wholesale of own-brand spirits and wine in the People s Republic of China (the PRC ). 

Details of the subsidiaries are set out
in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. 

(b) 
 Basis of consolidation and presentation 

The Consolidated Financial Statements
include the financial statements of Oranco, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. 

Subsidiaries are all entities over which
the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its involvement
with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated
from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. 

The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. The Company operates in one reportable
segment and solely within the PRC. Accordingly, no segment or geographic information has been presented. 

(c) 
 Financial instruments 

Financial instruments of the Group primarily
consist of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, deposits, prepayments and other receivables, prepaid land lease, trade payables,
receipts in advance, accruals and other payables, and bank borrowings. The carrying values of the Group s financial instruments
approximate their fair values, principally because of the short-term maturity of these instruments or their terms. 

The Group has no derivative financial
instruments. 

(d) 
 Cash and cash equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents consist of
cash on hand and highly liquid investments which are unrestricted as to withdrawal or use, and which have maturities of three months or
less when purchased.

 (Amounts in RMB and US , except for number of shares and per share
data) 

1. 
 SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 

(e) 
 Revenue recognition 

Our revenue consists primarily of the
sale of own-brand products, wine, and co-branded products with Fenjiu Liquor in the China. Sales of products are for cash or otherwise
agreed-upon credit terms. Our payment terms vary by location and customer. Our customers consist primarily of wholesale distributors.
Our revenue generating activities have a single performance obligation and are recognized at the point in time when control transfers
and our obligation has been fulfilled, which is when the related goods are delivered to the customer, depending upon the method of distribution,
and shipping terms. We have elected to treat transportation as a fulfillment activity. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration
we expect to receive in exchange for our product. Our sales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any
manufacturing defects on our part. Certain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration.
We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe that there will not
be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. 

(f) 
 Non-marketable investments 

We account for non-marketable equity
investments through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method. Our non-marketable
equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative. Under the measurement
alternative, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments is adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical
or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction
date and are recorded as a component of other income (expense), net. Non-marketable investments that do not have stated contractual maturity
dates are classified as non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets 

(g) 
 Impairment of investments 

We periodically review our non-marketable
equity investments for impairment. We consider whether impairment indicators exist by evaluating the companies financial and liquidity
position, access to capital resources and the time since the last adjustment to fair value, among others. If the assessment indicates
that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value by recording the corresponding charge as a component of
other income (expense), net. Fair value is estimated using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or
other available market data. 

(h) 
 Accounts receivable and allowance for credit loss 

Accounts receivables are stated at the
amount the Group expects to collect. The Group maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses. Management considers the
following factors when determining the collectability of specific accounts: historical experience, creditworthiness of the clients, aging
of the receivables and other specific circumstances related to the accounts. Allowance for doubtful accounts is made and recorded into
general and administrative expenses based on the aging of trade receivables and on any specifically identified receivables that may become
uncollectible. Trade receivables which are deemed to be uncollectible are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection
have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company takes a write-off of the account balances when the
Company can demonstrate all means of collection on the outstanding balances have been exhausted. For the period ended September 30, 2020,
our assessment considered the impact of COVID-19 and estimates of expected credit and collectability trends. Volatility in market conditions
and evolving credit trends are difficult to predict and may cause variability and volatility that may have an impact on our allowance
for credit losses in future periods. There is no allowance for doubtful accounts in these Consolidated Financial Statements.

 SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 

(i) 
 Inventory 

Inventory consists of raw materials, processing
cost of finished goods and finished products. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined
using the weighted average method. The Group routinely evaluate the net realizable value of the inventories in light of current market
conditions and market trends and record a write-down against the cost of inventories should the net realizable value falls below the cost. 

(j) 
 Property and equipment 

Property, plant and equipment are carried
at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recorded impairment. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following
estimated useful lives: 

Category 
 
 Estimated
 useful life 
 
 Estimated
 residual values 
 
 Building

 0-10 
 
 Computer and office equipment 
 
 3 years 
 
 0-10 
 
 Leasehold improvement 
 
 Over the shorter of lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets 

Repairs and maintenance are expensed as
incurred and asset improvements are capitalized. Consideration is given at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication
of impairment of the carrying amounts of the property, plant and equipment. The indication could be an unfavorable development of a business
or severe economic slowdown as well as reorganization of the operation. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are
discounted to their present value, based on the time value of money and the risks specific to the country where the assets are located. 

(k) 
 VAT and VAT refund 

VAT on sales is charged at 13 on revenue
from product sale and is subsequently paid to the PRC tax authorities after netting input VAT on purchases. The excess of output VAT over
input VAT is recognized in other payables, and the excess of input VAT over output VAT is recognized in other receivables in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. 

(l) 
 Operating leases 

We determine if an arrangement is a lease
at inception. Payments under our lease arrangements are fixed. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the
future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments
is our incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental borrowing
rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments
where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably
certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and
liabilities. Lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives. The current portion of our operating lease liabilities
is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Should there be long term portion, the non-current lease liabilities will
be included in operating lease liabilities. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

(m) 
 Foreign currency translation 

All of the Group s operations are
conducted in China and as a result, the functional and reporting currency of the Group is the Chinese Renminbi. 

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in currencies other than the applicable functional currencies are translated into the functional currencies at the prevailing rates of
exchange at the balance sheet date. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are converted into the functional currency
at the applicable rates of exchange prevailing at the transaction dates. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated
statements of operations. 

In translating the financial statements
of the Company s subsidiaries outside the PRC into the reporting currency, assets and liabilities are translated from the subsidiaries 
functional currencies to the reporting currency at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Equity amounts are translated at historical
exchange rates; revenues, expenses, and other gains and losses are translated using the average rate for the period. Translation adjustments
are reported as cumulative translation adjustments and are shown as a separate component of other comprehensive income/(loss) in the consolidated
statements of comprehensive income. During 2020 and 2019, such translation adjustments were not material. 

The Group uses the average exchange rate
for the year and the exchange rate at the balance sheet date to translate the operating results and financial position, respectively. 

Convenience translation 

Amounts in US are presented for the convenience
of the reader and are translated at the noon buying rate of US 1.00 to RMB 6.7896 on September 30, 2020 and RMB 7.0651 on June 30, 2020,
representing the noon buying rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. No representation is made
that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be converted, realized or settled into US at such rate or at any other rate. 

(n) 
 Income taxes 

Income taxes are provided for in accordance
with the laws and regulations applicable to the Group as enacted by the relevant tax authorities. The impact of an uncertain income tax
position on the income tax return is recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit of the related
tax authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained. Changes
in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Group records interest and penalties
related to unrecognized tax benefits (if any) in interest expenses and general and administrative expenses, respectively. 

(o) 
 COVID-19 impact 

The novel coronavirus, or COVID-19,
pandemic has created, and may continue to create, significant uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions. The full extent to which the COVID-19
pandemic will directly or indirectly impact the global economy, the lasting social effects, and impact on the Company s business,
results of operations, and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.
As of the date of issuance of the financial statements, the Company is not aware of any specific event of circumstance related to COVID-19
that would require it to update its estimates or judgments or adjust the carrying value of its assets or liabilities. Actual results could
differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements. As events continue to evolve
and additional information becomes available, the Company s estimates and assumptions may change materially in future periods.

(p) 
 Fair value measurement 

The Group defines fair value as the price
that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date. 

When determining the fair value measurements
for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Group considers the principal or most advantageous
market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. 

The Group s financial instruments
include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other receivables, accounts payable, other payables. The Group considers the carrying
amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. 

(q) 
 Business combinations 

We include the results of operations of
the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets
and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are
expensed as incurred. 

(r) 
 Transactions between entities under common control 

When accounting for a transfer of assets
or exchange of shares between entities under common control of the Group, the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities transferred
shall remain unchanged subsequent to the transaction, and no gain or loss shall be recorded in the Group s consolidated statements
of operations. 

(s) 
 Commitments and contingencies 

In the normal course of business, the
Group is subject to loss contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business, that cover a wide range of matters,
including, among others, government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, and non-income tax matters. An accrual for a loss contingency
is recognized when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If a potential
material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent
liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material, is disclosed. 

(t) 
 Stock split 

On July 22, 2019, the Company s
board of directors approved an amendment to its certificate of incorporation to effect a split of shares of the issued and outstanding
common at a one share for every ten shares ratio. The stock split was approved by the Company s stockholders and effected
on August 7, 2019. 

We record the reverse stock split to reduce
the common stock and increase additional paid-in capital. 

All issued and outstanding shares of common
stock amounts contained in these consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect these stock splits for all periods presented.

(u) 
 Software development costs 

We expense software development costs,
including costs to develop software products or the software to be sold, leased or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility
is reached. Technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products and as a result, development costs
that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented. 

Software development costs also include
costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications
once the preliminary project sage is complete and it is probable that the project will be complete, and the software will be used to perform
the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented. 

(v) 
 Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

In August 2020, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other
Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible
Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity, which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics
of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity s own equity. Under current GAAP, there
are five accounting models for convertible debt instruments. ASU 2020-06 removes from U.S. GAAP the separation models for (1) convertible
debt with a cash conversion feature and (2) convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature. As a result, after adopting
the ASU s guidance, entities will not separately present in equity an embedded conversion feature in such debt. Instead, they will
account for a convertible debt instrument wholly as debt, and for convertible preferred stock wholly as preferred stock (i.e., as a single
unit of account), unless (1) a convertible instrument contains features that require bifurcation as a derivative under ASC 815 or (2)
a convertible debt instrument was issued at a substantial premium. Additionally, for convertible debt instruments with substantial premiums
accounted for as paid-in capital, the FASB decided to add disclosures about (1) the fair value amount and the level of fair value hierarchy
of the entire instrument for public business entities and (2) the premium amount recorded as paid-in capital. ASU 2020-06 will be effective
for public business entities that meet the definition of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filer, excluding entities eligible
to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods
within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of
this accounting pronouncement to its financial statements. 

Although there are several other new
accounting pronouncements issued or proposed by the FASB, which the Company has adopted or will adopt, as applicable, the Company does
not believe any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results
of operations.

 SHORT-TERM OPERATING LEASE 

On September 30, 2019, the Company
adopted ASU 2016-02 using the modified retrospective method as of the effective date of September 30, 2019 (the effective
date method ). Under the effective date method, financial results reported prior to 2019 are unchanged. In transition to the new
lease guidance, the Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard
that allowed the Company to not reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease, lease classification and initial direct costs; however,
the Company did not elect the hindsight transitional practical expedient. The Company has also elected the practical expedient to not
account for lease components (e.g., fixed payments including rent, real estate taxes and insurance costs) separately from the non-lease
components. After assessment of the cumulative impact of adopting ASU 2016-02, it was determined that the cumulative effect
adjustment required under the new guidance was immaterial and therefore the Company did not record a retrospective adjustment to the opening
balance of retained earnings at September 30, 2020. The Company has not recognised any additional short-term operating lease right-of-use
assets or lease liabilities as of September 30, 2020. 

The Company is a lessee under a number
of operating leases for offices and staff residence. The Company s leases generally have remaining lease terms of 3 months to 1
years and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year. These leases do not have rent escalation holidays, concessions,
leasehold improvement incentives, or other build-out clauses. Further, the leases do not contain contingent rent provisions.

required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Control and Procedures . 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our president and controller, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our president and treasurer
concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective,
based on having insufficient resources to establish an effective control and procedures environment during the quarter covered by this
10-Q report. Although we do have a subcontracted outside accountant, there is not enough personnel to establish proper controls and procedures
with checks and balances at this time. 

Management s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s
principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company s board of directors, management and other personnel,
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures
that: 

Apply to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

24 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of
the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this
risk. 

We carried out an assessment, under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal
controls over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of September
30, 2020. Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that assessment and on those criteria, our CEO and CFO concluded that our internal control
over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2020. The principal basis for this conclusion is failure to engage sufficient
resources in regards to our accounting and reporting obligations. 

Remediation 

We have initiated remediation efforts to continue
strengthening our internal control over financial reporting and to specifically address the control deficiencies that led to our material
weaknesses. These efforts include the following: 

Required all of the accounting personnel in the accounting department to take a minimum of 24 CPE credits annually with a focus on US GAAP and financial reporting standards. We also required the Chief Financial Officer to take a minimum of 40 CPE credits annually with a focus on US GAAP and financial reporting standards; 

Implemented an internal review process over financial reporting to continue to improve our ongoing review and supervision of our internal control over financial reporting; and 

Implemented an ongoing initiative and training in the Company to ensure the importance of internal controls and compliance with the established policies and procedures are fully understood throughout the organization, and we plan to provide continuous US GAAP knowledge training to relevant employees involved to ensure the performance of and the compliance with those procedures and policies. 

We cannot assure you that the measures we have
taken to date, and are continuing to implement, will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses we have identified or avoid potential
future material weaknesses. If the steps we take do not remediate the material weaknesses in a timely manner, we will be unable to conclude
that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures or effective internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, these
material weaknesses could result in a misstatement of our accounts or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of our
annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

We plan to enhance our internal controls over
financial reporting related to this new adoption to ensure all related accounting policy and disclosures reflect this change. 

Except for the aforementioned remediation plans,
there have not been any other changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules
13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2019, to have materially affected the Company s internal
control over financial reporting.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K 
229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, 
as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1). 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Control and Procedures . 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our president and controller, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our president and treasurer
concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective,
based on having insufficient resources to establish an effective control and procedures environment during the first quarter of 2020.
Although we do have a subcontracted outside accountant, there is not enough personnel to establish proper controls and procedures with
checks and balances at this time. 

A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance,
however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. We believe our disclosure on controls and procedures are designed
to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting during the last quarterly period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
