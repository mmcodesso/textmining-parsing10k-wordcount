We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. GENERAL INFORMATION We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 28, 2018. So far, the Company has no revenue, it possesses minimal assets and has incurred losses since inception. We maintain our office at 120 Moorgate, London EC2M 6UR, United Kingdom. Our telephone number is +44 77 4212 5992. We were initially engaged in the business of English language tutoring over the Internet. However, were not able to execute our original business plan, develop significant operations or achieve commercial sales. We currently are pursuing the completion of an acquisition which will create a viable business model and value for our stockholders. Effective November 9, 2020, Reinis Kosins, our former President and sole director resigned as an officer of the Company and from the Board of Directors, and Laura De Leon Castro was appointed as President, Secretary, Treasurer, Principal Executive Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, and sole director. On November 9, 2020, we issued an aggregate of 30,000,000 shares of our common stock, pursuant to conversions of debt by two entities as follows: (i) First Choice Marketing Group, LLC converted 35,000 of debt into 20,000,000 shares, which represent 61.70 of issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, and (ii) The Consulting Agency, LLC converted 16,003 of debt into 10,000,000 shares, which represents 30.85 of all issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. The common stock was not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. On December 31, 2020, the Company entered into a definitive Equity Purchase Agreement with Mercantile Global Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation MGH ). However, the parties could not consummate the transaction and on September 2, 2021, the Company and MGH entered into a Mutual Termination Agreement, whereby the parties agreed to terminate the Equity Purchase Agreement. The Mutual Termination Agreement provided for a mutual release of the parties. On October 17, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company which, at that time, consisted solely of Laura De Leon Castro, elected two new additional directors, Timothy Ambrose and Jon-Paul Doran. On October 18, 2021, Laura De Leon Castro resigned as President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Treasurer, and a Director and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company. Concurrently, Timothy Ambrose was elected as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Jon-Paul Doran was elected as President, Chief Executive Officer, and Secretary of the Company. 3 Table of Contents On April 13, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive Share Exchange Agreement (the Exchange Agreement with the stockholders of Eco Equity Limited, a company organized under the laws of England and Wales EE UK ). Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the Company will acquire 100 of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of EE UK, in exchange for the issuance of 42,000,000 restricted newly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of the Company (the Exchange Shares at a ratio of 0.0763 Exchange Share for each of the surrendered shares transferred by the EE UK stockholders, which will represent fifty-six percent (56 of all issued and outstanding shares of Company common stock at the time of the closing of the transaction. The Exchange Shares were valued at 71,404 or .0017 per share.

In addition, we will assume all assets and liabilities of EE UK, which includes EE UK s wholly owned subsidiary, Eco-Equity Zimbabwe (Private) Limited, a Zimbabwe-registered company EE Zim ).

Our common stock currently trades on the Expert Market Tier of OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the symbol CINV and is labeled as Delinquent SEC Reporting. The OTC Market is a network of security dealers who buy and sell stock. The dealers are connected by a computer network that provides information on current bids and asks, as well as volume information. Stock on the Expert Market is not eligible for proprietary broker-dealer quotations. All quotes in stock on the Expert Market reflect unsolicited customer orders. Unsolicited-Only stocks, such as ours, have a higher risk of wider spreads between bid and asked quotations, increased volatility, and price dislocations. Investors may have difficulty selling our stock. An initial review by a broker-dealer under SEC Rule15c2-11 is required for brokers to publish competing quotes and provide continuous market making in our stock. The Expert Market serves broker-dealer pricing and investor best execution needs. Quotations in Expert Market securities are restricted from public viewing. OTC Markets Group designates securities for quoting on the Expert Market when the issuer has not disclosed its financial information for a period of slightly in excess of six months or is otherwise not making current information publicly available under SEC Rule 15c2-11, or when the security is otherwise restricted from public quoting. The common stock previously traded on the Pink Tier of OTC Markets Group, Inc. The reported high and low prices for our common stock are shown below for the period from January 1, 2020 through June 29, 2022. All quoted prices reflect inter-dealer prices without retail markup, mark-down or commission and may not necessarily represent actual transactions. 2022 (1) (2) 2021 (1) 2020 (1) High Low High Bid Low Bid High Bid Low Bid First Quarter ended March 31 11.99 11.99 8.00 4.05 - - Second Quarter ended June 30 11.99 11.99 4.50 3.20 - - Third Quarter ended September 30 - - 12.00 4.00 4.25 3.00 Fourth Quarter ended December 31 - - 11.00 8.00 5.00 0.0017 (1) The Company s Registration Statement on Form S-1 was declared effective by the SEC on April 8, 2019. The first quoted prices did not occur until September 9, 2020. There has been very limited trading from September 9, 2020 through June 27, 2022. (2) The second quarter of 2022 is for the period April 1, 2022 through June 29, 2022. Registered Holders of our Common Stock As of June 27, 2022, there were 5 record owners of our common stock. We believe that some additional stockholders hold stock on deposit with their brokers or investment bankers registered in the name of stock depositories. Dividends The Company has not declared any dividends since inception and does not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future on its common stock. The payment of dividends is within the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the Company s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other relevant factors. There are no restrictions that currently limit the Company s ability to pay dividends on its common stock other than those generally imposed by applicable state law. Equity Compensation Plans None Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities In October 2020, we agreed to settle two accounts payable totaling 51,003 by the issuance of an aggregate of 30,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock, or 0.0017 or share. The shares were issued in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and the provisions of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its Common Stock. 5 Table of Contents Penny Stock Designation The SEC has adopted Rule 3a51-1, which defines a penny stock as any equity security that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Because the price of our Common Stock is less than 5.00 (and we do not meet any of the alternative exemptive criteria), our Common Stock is deemed to be a penny stock. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, Rule 15g-9 requires that a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i) the purchaser s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the penny stock rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our Common Stock and cause a decline in the market value of our Common Stock. Item 6. [Reserved] Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW We are a development stage corporation with limited operations and no revenues from our business operations. We do not anticipate that we will generate significant revenues until we have raised significant funds. There is no assurance we will ever generate revenue even if we raised all necessary funds. GOING CONCERN Our financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We are in start-up stage operations and have not generated any revenues. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders. COVID-19 In December 2019, a novel strain of COVID-19 was reported in China. Since then, the COVID-19 has spread globally including across North America and the United States. The spread of COVID-19 from China to other countries has resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic, or a worldwide spread of a new disease, on March 11, 2020. Specifically, we caution that our business could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to the outbreak of COVID-19. To date, COVID has directly impacted the ability we have to participate in trade show events and other in-person marketing. Although retailers which may carry our products may be considered essential businesses and therefore be allowed to remain operational, they may experience significantly reduced demand. The risk of a pandemic, or public perception of the risk, could cause customers to avoid public places, including retail properties, and could cause temporary or long-term disruptions in our supply chains and/or delays in the delivery of our inventory to our customers. Further, such risks could also adversely affect retail customers financial condition, resulting in reduced spending on our products, which are marketed as premium products. Shelter-in-place or other such orders by governmental entities could also disrupt our operations, if our employees or the employees of our sourcing partners who cannot perform their responsibilities from home, are not able to report to work. Risks related to an epidemic, pandemic, or other health crisis, such as COVID-19, could also lead to the complete or partial closure of one or more of our co-packing facilities or operations of our sourcing partners.

Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the Company will acquire 100 of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of EE UK, in exchange for the issuance of 42,000,000 restricted newly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of the Company (the Exchange Shares at a ratio of 0.0763 Exchange Share for each of the surrendered shares transferred by the EE UK stockholders, which will represent fifty-six percent (56 of all issued and outstanding shares of Company common stock at the time of the closing of the transaction. The Exchange Shares were valued at 71,404 or .0017 per share. As the Company s stock is thinly traded, the value assigned to the Exchange Shares to be issued under the Exchange Agreement was the last sale of Company s common stock during October 2020 for .0017 per share. In addition, we will assume all assets and liabilities of EE UK, which includes EE UK s wholly owned subsidiary, Eco-Equity Zimbabwe (Private) Limited, a Zimbabwe-registered company EE Zim ). As of June 27, 2022, the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement, including the issuance of the 42,000,000 Exchange Shares, has not been consummated. The Company intends to pursue the sale of cannabis-related products from EE Zim. 7 Table of Contents On October 17, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company which, at that time, consisted solely of Laura De Leon Castro, elected two new additional directors, Timothy Ambrose and Jon-Paul Doran. On October 18, 2021, Laura De Leon Castro resigned as President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Treasurer, and a Director and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company.

Concurrently, Timothy Ambrose was elected as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Jon-Paul Doran was elected as President, Chief Executive Officer, and Secretary of the Company. The appointment of Mr. Ambrose and Mr. Doran was considered a change in control of the Company. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data The Company s Financial Statements required by Item 8, together with the reports thereon of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm are set forth on pages F-1 through F-11 of this report and are incorporated by reference in this Item 8. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accounting and Financial Disclosures. None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management s control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our CEO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based upon this evaluation, our CEO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which is described below. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 8 Table of Contents Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2021. Our CEO concluded we have a material weakness due to lack of segregation of duties, a limited corporate governance structure, and a lack of a formal management review process over preparation of financial information. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our size has prevented us from being able to employ sufficient resources to enable us to have an adequate level of supervision and segregation of duties within our system of internal control. Therefore, while there are some compensating controls in place, it is difficult to ensure effective segregation of accounting and financial reporting duties. Management reported the following material weaknesses: Lack of segregation of duties in certain accounting and financial reporting processes including the initiation, processing, recording and approval of disbursements; Our corporate governance responsibilities are performed by the Board of Directors, none of whom are independent under applicable standards; we do not have an audit committee or compensation committee. Our Board of Directors acts primarily by written consent without meetings which results in several of our corporate governance functions not being performed concurrent (or timely) with the underlying transactions, including evaluation of the application of accounting principles and disclosures relating to those transactions; and Certain reports that we prepare, and accounting and reporting conclusions reached in connection with the financial statement preparation process are not subjected to a formal review process that includes multiple levels of review and are not submitted timely to the Board of Directors for review or approval. While we strive to segregate duties as much as practicable, there is an insufficient volume of transactions at this point in time to justify additional full-time staff. We believe that this is typical in many development-stage companies. We may not be able to fully remediate the material weakness until we commence operations at which time, we would expect to hire more staff. We will continue to monitor and assess the costs and benefits of additional staffing. This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the SEC rules that permit us to provide only management s report in this Annual Report. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
