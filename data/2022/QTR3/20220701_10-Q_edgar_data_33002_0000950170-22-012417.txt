 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 FOR THE PERIOD ENDED MAY 31, 2022 

Significant Judgments Generally, the Company s contracts with customers are comprised of a written quote and customer purchase order or statement of work, and governed by the Company s trade terms and conditions. In certain instances, it may be further supplemented by separate pricing agreements and customer incentive arrangements, which typically only affect the transaction price. Contracts do not contain a significant financing component as payment terms on invoiced amounts are typically between to , based on the Company s credit assessment of individual customers, as well as industry expectations. Product returns are not significant. From time to time, the Company may offer incentives to its customers considered to be variable consideration including volume-based rebates or early payment discounts. Customer incentives considered to be variable consideration are recorded as a reduction to revenue as part of the transaction price at contract inception when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the incentive and only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of any incremental revenue will not occur. Customer incentives are allocated entirely to the single performance obligation of transferring printed product to the customer. For customers with terms of FOB shipping point, the Company accounts for shipping and handling activities performed after the control of the printed product has been transferred to the customer as a fulfillment cost. The Company accrues for the costs of shipping and handling activities if revenue is recognized before contractually agreed shipping and handling activities occur. The Company s contracts with customers are generally short-term in nature. Accordingly, the Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations nor the timing of revenue recognition.

 and of its inventories valued at the lower of last-in first-out LIFO for the periods ended May 31, 2022 and February 28, 2022, respectively, the Company values its inventories at the lower of first-in, first-out FIFO cost or net realizable value. The Company regularly reviews inventories on hand, using specific aging categories, and writes down the carrying value of its inventories for excess and potentially obsolete inventories based on historical usage and estimated future usage. In assessing the ultimate realization of its inventories, the Company is required to make judgments as to future demand requirements. As actual future demand or market conditions may vary from those projected by the Company, adjustments to inventories may be required.

of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Management utilizes valuation techniques appropriate for the asset or liability being measured in determining these fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over amounts allocated to assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed, is recorded as goodwill. Where amounts allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is greater than the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recognized. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. On June 1, 2021, the Company acquired the assets and business from AmeriPrint Corporation AmeriPrint ), which is based in Harvard, Illinois, for million in cash plus the assumption of trade payables, subject to certain adjustments. Goodwill of million recognized as a part of the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes. The Company also recorded intangible assets with definite lives of approximately million in connection with the transaction. The acquisition of AmeriPrint which prior to the acquisition generated approximately million in sales for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, brings added capabilities and expertise to our expanding product offering including barcoding and variable imaging.

 years, with certain leases including renewal options to extend the leases for additional periods at the Company s discretion. At lease inception, all renewal options reasonably certain to be exercised are considered when determining the lease term. The Company currently does not have leases that include options to purchase or provisions that would automatically transfer ownership of the leased property to the Company. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and variable lease payments are expensed as incurred. The Company had variable lease costs for the three months ended May 31, 2022 and May 31, 2021. The Company determines whether a contract is or contains a lease at the inception of the contract. A contract will be deemed to be or contain a lease if the contract conveys the right to control and direct the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company generally must also have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the property, plant, and equipment. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. To determine the present value of lease payments not yet paid, the Company estimates incremental borrowing rates based on the BBB Corporate Bond Rate at lease commencement date as rates are not implicitly stated in most leases.

The Company is required to make contributions to the Pension Plan. These contributions are required under the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA ). Due to the enactment of the Highway and Transportation Funding Act (HATFA) in August 2014, plan sponsors can calculate the discount rate used to measure the Pension Plan liability using a -year average of interest rates plus or minus a corridor. The Company s minimum required contribution to the Pension Plan is for the Pension Plan year ending February 28, 2023.

 Overview 
 Ennis, Inc. (formerly Ennis Business Forms, Inc.) (collectively with its subsidiaries, the Company, Registrant, Ennis, or we, us, or our was organized under the laws of Texas in 1909. We and our subsidiaries print and manufacture a broad line of business forms and other business products. We distribute business products and forms throughout the United States primarily through independent distributors. This distributor channel encompasses independent print distributors, commercial printers, direct mail, fulfillment companies, payroll and accounts payable software companies, and advertising agencies, among others.

 Business Overview 
 Our management believes we are the largest provider of business forms, pressure-seal forms, labels, tags, envelopes, and presentation folders to independent distributors in the United States. 
 We are in the business of manufacturing, designing, and selling business forms and other printed business products primarily to distributors located in the United States. We operate 55 manufacturing plants throughout the United States in 20 strategically located states as one reportable segment. Approximately 94 of the business products we manufacture are custom and semi-custom products, constructed in a wide variety of sizes, colors, number of parts, and quantities on an individual job basis, depending upon the customers specifications. 
 The products we sell include snap sets, continuous forms, laser cut sheets, tags, labels, envelopes, integrated products, jumbo rolls and pressure sensitive products in short, medium and long runs under the following labels: Ennis , Royal Business Forms , Block Graphics , Specialized Printed Forms , 360 Custom Labels SM , ColorWorx , Enfusion , Uncompromised Check Solutions , VersaSeal , Ad Concepts SM , FormSource Limited SM , Star Award Ribbon Company , Witt Printing , B D Litho , Genforms , PrintGraphics , Calibrated Forms , PrintXcel , Printegra , Forms Manufacturers SM , Mutual Graphics , TRI-C Business Forms SM , Major Business Systems SM , Independent Printing SM , Hoosier Data Forms , Hayes Graphics , Wright Business Graphics SM , Wright 360 SM , Integrated Print Graphics SM , the Flesh Company SM , Impressions Direct SM , Ace Forms SM and Ameriprint SM . We also sell the Adams McClure brand (which provides Point of Purchase advertising for large franchise and fast food chains as well as kitting and fulfillment); the Admore , Folder Express , and Independent Folders brands (which provide presentation folders and document folders); Ennis Tag Label SM (which provides custom printed, high performance labels and custom and stock tags); Allen-Bailey Tag Label SM , Atlas Tag Label , Kay Toledo Tag , and Special Service Partners (SSP) (which provides custom and stock tags and labels); Trade Envelopes , Block Graphics , Wisco , and National Imprint Corporation (which provide custom and imprinted envelopes) and Northstar and General Financial Supply (which provide financial and security documents); Infoseal SM and PrintXcel (which provide custom and stock pressure seal documents). We sell predominantly through independent distributors, as well as to many of our competitors. Northstar Computer Forms, Inc., one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, also sells direct to a small number of customers, generally large banking organizations (where a distributor is not acceptable or available to the end-user). Adams McClure, LP, a wholly-owned subsidiary, also sells direct to a small number of customers, where sales are generally through advertising agencies. 
 The printing industry generally sells its products either predominantly to end users, a market dominated by a few large manufacturers, such as R.R. Donnelley and Sons, Staples, Inc., Standard Register Co. (a subsidiary of Taylor Corporation), and Cenveo, Inc., or, like the Company, through a variety of independent distributors and distributor groups. While it is not possible, because of the lack of adequate public statistical information, to determine the Company s share of the total business products market, management believes the Company is the largest producer of business forms, pressure-seal forms, labels, tags, envelopes, and presentation folders in the United States distributing primarily through independent distributors. 
 There are a number of competitors that operate in this segment, ranging in size from single employee-owned operations to multi-plant organizations. We believe our strategic locations and buying power permit us to compete on a favorable basis within the distributor market on competitive factors, such as service, quality, and price. 
 Distribution of business forms and other business products throughout the United States is primarily done through independent distributors, including business forms distributors, resellers, direct mail, commercial printers, payroll and accounts payable software companies, and advertising agencies. 
 Raw materials principally consist of a wide variety of weights, widths, colors, sizes, and qualities of paper for business products purchased primarily from one major supplier at favorable prices based on the volume of business. 
 Business products usage in the printing industry is generally not seasonal. General economic conditions and contraction of the traditional business forms industry are the predominant factors in quarterly volume fluctuations. 
 
 Recent Acquisitions 
 On June 1, 2021, we acquired the assets and business of AmeriPrint in Harvard, Illinois. The acquisition of Ameriprint, which prior to the acquisition generated approximately 6.5 million in sales for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, brings added capabilities and expertise to our expanding product offering including barcoding and variable imaging.

 Our Business Challenges 
 Our industry is currently experiencing consolidation of traditional supply channels, product obsolescence, paper supplier capacity adjustments, and increased pricing and potential supply allocations due to demand/supply curve imbalance. Technology advances have made electronic distribution of documents, internet hosting, digital printing and print-on-demand valid, cost-effective alternatives to traditional custom-printed documents and customer communications. Improved equipment has become more accessible to our competitors. We face highly competitive conditions throughout our supply chain in an already over-supplied, price-competitive print industry. The challenges of our business include the following: 
 COVID-19 Pandemic The global spread of the novel strain of COVID-19 has significantly impacted health and economic conditions throughout the United States and the world, including the markets in which we operate. Beginning in March 2020 in response to the sales impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we made modifications to our cost structure by reducing employee cost, ceasing operations at an under-utilized facility, as well as exiting two facilities with expiring leases and moving production to our other facilities. The Company saw economic improvement during fiscal year ending February 28, 2022 and we continue to see strong demand for our product. Although the U.S. economy has gained in recovery, it continues to be significantly impacted by supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and shifting demand. 
 There continue to be significant uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. And the full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company s control discussed under the caption, Risk Factors in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022. For further information, please see Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, above and Risk Factors contained within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022. 
 We will continue to monitor incoming order volume as well as rising raw material and other input costs so that we can proactively adjust our pricing and costs accordingly. 
 Transformation of our portfolio of products While traditional business documents are essential in order to conduct business, many are being replaced through the use of cheaper paper grades or imported paper, or devalued with advances in digital technologies, causing steady declines in demand for a portion of our current product line. In addition, the impact of COVID-19 on the speed of this transformation is unknown, but it is expected to accelerate the decline for some of our products. Transforming our product offerings in order to continue to provide innovative, valuable solutions through lower labor and fixed charges to our customers on a proactive basis will require us to make investments in new and existing technology and to develop key strategic business relationships, such as print-on-demand services and product offerings that assist customers in their transition to digital business environments. In addition, we will continue to look for new market opportunities and niches through acquisitions, such as the addition of our envelope offerings, tag offerings, folder offerings, healthcare wristbands, specialty packaging, direct mail, pressure seal products, secure document solutions, innovative in-mold label offerings and long-run integrated products with high color web printing, which provide us with an opportunity for growth and differentiate us from our competition. The ability to make investments in new and existing technology and/or to acquire new market opportunities through acquisitions is dependent on the Company s liquidity and operational results. While currently the pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity and it is not currently expected to, a protracted delay or reversal in the economy recovering could have a negative impact on our continued ability to make the aforementioned investments or to consummate acquisitions. 
 Production capacity and price competition within our industry Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar can have a significant impact on the pricing and supply of paper. The weakening of the U.S. dollar will usually result in the dissipation of any pricing advantage that foreign imports have over domestic suppliers, which typically results in lower levels of imported papers and an increase in domestic exports. With increased pricing power, domestic paper producers can better control the supply of paper by eliminating capacity or changing the products produced on their large paper machines. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar usually has the opposite effect: more cheap imported paper; less domestic exports; and lower pricing power in the hands of domestic paper producers. Domestic paper suppliers typically seek to balance supply and demand, including by (if possible) taking capacity out of the market, whether by taking production off-line or switching production to alternative paper products. Generally, if mills are running at high capacity, suppliers are able to raise prices. 
 As the economy has improved, demand has increased for coated and uncoated freesheet papers which has reduced the excess inventory in the market. It is unclear whether this is a temporary situation or if conditions could stretch for a more extended amount of time. Regardless of these factors, many of which are cyclical, we continue to believe paper pricing will remain in a range which will not unfavorably impact our margins. Additionally, the possibility of paper shortages in the market is not a major concern due to our primary material supplier s commitment to the Company. Consistent with our historical practice, we intend to continue to focus on effectively managing and controlling our product costs through the use of forecasting, production and costing models, as well as working closely with our domestic suppliers to reduce our procurement costs, in order to minimize effects on our operational results. In addition, we 
 21 
 
 ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 FORM 10-Q 
 FOR THE PERIOD ENDED MAY 31, 2022 
 
 will continue to look for ways to reduce and leverage our fixed costs. 
 Continued consolidation of our customers Our customers are distributors, many of which are consolidating or are being acquired by competitors. We continue to maintain a majority of the business we have had with our customers historically, but it is possible that these consolidations and acquisitions, which we expect to continue in the future, ultimately will impact our margins and sales. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the disclosures and reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis, including those related to allowance for doubtful receivables, inventory valuations, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, pension plan obligations, accrued liabilities and income taxes. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical due to their effect on our more significant estimates and judgments used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For additional information, reference is made to the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022. 
 Results of Operations 
 The following discussion provides information which we believe is relevant to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. The discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which are incorporated herein by reference. The operating results of the Company for the three months ended May 31, 2022 and the comparative period for 2021 are set forth in the unaudited consolidated financial information included in the tables below.

 Three months ended May 31, 2022 compared to three months ended May 31, 2021 
 Net Sales. Our net sales were 107.7 million for the quarter ended May 31, 2022, compared to 96.9 million for the same quarter in the prior year, an increase of 10.7 million, or 11.1 . AmeriPrint, our acquisition completed on June 1, 2021, added 1.9 million in sales for the current quarter. Our net sales increased 8.0 million or 8.0 on a sequential quarter basis as well, from 99.7 million for the quarter ended February 28, 2022 to 107.7 million for the current quarter. Our revenues increased due to continued strong customer demand for our products and increase in pricing to cover inflationary costs. 
 Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit Margin. Our cost of goods sold increased 5.9 million, or 8.7 , from 67.7 million for the three months ended May 31, 2021 to 73.7 million for the three months ended May 31, 2022. Our gross profit was 34.0 million for the quarter ended May 31, 2022 compared to 29.2 million for the same quarter in the prior year. We made pricing adjustments to cover inflationary costs and improved operational efficiencies all of which contributed to improve our gross profit margin to 31.6 compared to 27.5 from our sequential quarter and improved from the prior year s first quarter of 30.1 . 
 Selling, general, and administrative expense. For the three months ended May 31, 2022, our selling, general, and administrative SG A expenses were 17.7 million compared to 18.9 million for the three months ended May 31, 2021, a decrease of 1.2 million, or 6.5 . As a percentage of net sales, SG A expenses for the current quarter were 16.4 and 19.5 for the three months ended May 31, 2022 and May 31, 2021, respectively. The decrease in SG A costs were a result of savings from operational efficiencies and the consolidation of our underperforming manufacturing facilities in the prior year, as well as 0.8 million in restricted stock expense related to the grant awarded in the prior year quarter during the transition of our Long-Term Incentive Equity Awards program. 
 Gain from disposal of assets. The 0.3 million net gain from disposal of assets during the prior year quarter is primarily attributed to the sale of a building that had transferred its operations to another facility. 
 Income from operations. Primarily due to factors described above, our income from operations for the three months ended May 31, 2022 was 16.3 million, or 15.2 of net sales, as compared to 10.5 million, or 10.9 of net sales, for the three months ended May 31, 2021 and increased on a sequential quarter basis as well from 10.5 million for the quarter ended February 28, 2022. 
 Other expense. Other expense was 0.2 million for the three months ended May 31, 2022 compared to expense of 0.1 million for the three months ended May 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to an increase in our pension expense of 0.1 million over the comparable quarter. 
 Provision for income taxes. Our effective tax rate was 28.0 for the three months ended May 31, 2022 as compared to 30.0 for the three months ended May 31, 2021. The primary reason for the decrease in the effective tax rate is permanent non-deductible expense resulting from final distributions in the prior year from our deferred compensation plan which was terminated in November 2020. 
 Net earnings. Net earnings, due to the factors above, were 11.6 million for the three months ended May 31, 2022 as compared to 7.3 million for the comparable quarter in the prior year, an increase of 4.3 million. Net earnings per diluted share for the three months ended May 31, 2022 was 0.45, compared to 0.28 for the same quarter in the prior year. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We rely on our cash flows generated from operations to meet cash requirements of our business. The primary cash requirements of our business are payments to vendors in the normal course of business, capital expenditures, compensation obligations and the payment of dividends to our shareholders. We expect to generate sufficient cash flows from operations necessary to cover our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe our strong liquidity position will help us mitigate the ongoing adverse impacts of COVID-19.

 Working Capital. On May 31, 2022, we had 91.2 million in cash. During the period, our cash position increased by 5.6 million and our working capital increased 8.4 million or 6.6 , from 127.8 million at February 28, 2022 to 136.2 million at May 31, 2022. Our current ratio, calculated by dividing our current assets by our current liabilities, decreased from 4.4 to 1.0 at February 28, 2022 to 4.3 to 1.0 at May 31, 2022. Our working capital was positively impacted primarily by an increase in our cash and inventories offset by an increase in our income taxes payable. Our current ratio was negatively impacted primarily by a 4.4 million increase in our income taxes payable.

Cash flows from operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was 14.2 million in the three months ended May 31, 2022 compared to 11.9 million in the comparative period ended May 31, 2021. Our operational earnings increased 4.3 million for the three months ended May 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended May 31, 2021. An increase in accounts receivable used cash of 2.0 million in the current quarter compared to a decrease in accounts receivable providing cash of 2.1 million in the prior year quarter. An increase in inventories used cash of 5.4 million in the three months ended May 31, 2022 compared to 3.4 million in the three months ended May 31, 2021. An increase in accounts payable provided cash of 4.4 million in the three months ended May 31, 2022 compared to an increase in accounts payable providing cash of 3.5 million in the three months ended May 31, 2021 and an increase in other assets in the prior year quarter used cash of 3.9 million. We continue to closely monitor and manage our outstanding trade receivables and inventories. During the current quarter, our days sales in our receivables decreased from 36 days to 35 days and our days sales of inventory remained level at 37 days. The Company continues to monitor incoming orders and is adjusting its raw material purchases accordingly. 
 
 Cash flows from investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was 1.0 million in the three months ended May 31, 2022 compared to cash provided from investing activities of 0.1 million in the three months ended May 31, 2021. Capital expenditures primarily of equipment was 1.0 million and 0.7 million for the three months ended May 31, 2022 and May 31, 2021, respectively. In the three months ended May 31, 2021, 0.8 million was provided from the sale of a building that had transferred its operations to another facility. 
 
 Cash flows from financing activities. We used 1.7 million more cash in financing activities during the three months ended May 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in cash used during the three months ended May 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended May 31, 2021 resulted from 1.1 million of common stock repurchased under our stock repurchase program in the current quarter compared to no repurchases of our common stock during the three months ended May 31, 2021 and the payment of 0.6 million more in dividends in the current quarter (25 cents per share) compared to the prior year quarter (22.5 cents per share). 
 
 Credit Facility. We did not renew our Credit Agreement, which expired November 11, 2021. We have had no outstanding long-term debt under the revolving credit line since paid in August 2019. As of May 31, 2022, we had 0.6 million outstanding under a standby letters of credit arrangement secured by a cash collateral bank account. It is anticipated that our cash and funds from operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund anticipated future expenses. 
 Pension Plan We are required to make contributions to our Pension Plan. These contributions are required under the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA ). Due to the enactment of the Highway and Transportation Funding Act (HATFA) in August 2014, which effectively raises the discount rates mandated for determining the value of a plan s benefit liability and annual cost of accruals, our minimum required contribution to the Pension Plan is zero for the Pension Plan year ending February 28, 2023. Assuming a stable funding status, we would expect that our future contributions to be between 1.0 million and 3.0 million per year. However, changes in actual investment returns or in discount rates could change this amount significantly. There was no contribution required to our Pension Plan in fiscal year 2022, however a 1.0 million contribution was made in November 2021 to avoid a PBGC Variable Premium. As our Pension Plan assets are invested in marketable securities, fluctuations in market values could potentially impact our funding status, associated liabilities recorded and future required minimum contributions. At May 31, 2022, we had an unfunded pension liability recorded on our balance sheet of 5.7 million. 
 Inventories We believe our inventory levels are sufficient to satisfy our customer demands and we anticipate having adequate sources of raw materials to meet future business requirements. We have long-term contracts in effect with paper suppliers that govern prices, but do not require minimum purchase commitments. Certain of our rebate programs do, however, require minimum purchase volumes. 
 Capital Expenditures We continue to make capital expenditures for operational maintenance purposes, as may be required. Additionally, we will carefully review and make new capital expenditures for equipment to the extent such expenditures make economic 
 24 
 
 ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 FORM 10-Q 
 FOR THE PERIOD ENDED MAY 31, 2022 
 
 sense by improving our operations and not jeopardizing our strong liquidity position. We expect our capital requirements for our current fiscal year, exclusive of capital required for possible acquisitions, will be within our historical levels of between 3.0 million and 5.0 million. For the quarter, we have spent approximately 1.0 million on capital expenditures. We expect to fund these expenditures through existing cash flows. 
 Contractual Obligations There have been no significant changes in our contractual obligations since February 28, 2022 that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. 
 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITA TIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market Risk 
 Interest Rates 
 From time to time, we are exposed to interest rate risk on short-term and long-term financial instruments carrying variable interest rates. We may from time to time utilize interest rate swaps to manage overall borrowing costs and reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates. We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. While we had no outstanding debt at May 31, 2022, we will be exposed to interest rate risk if we borrow in the future. 
 
 This market risk discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from this discussion based upon general market conditions and changes in domestic and global financial markets. 
 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. A review and evaluation were carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. Based upon that review and evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of May 31, 2022 are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Due to the inherent limitations of control systems, not all misstatements may be detected. Those inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls could be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more people. Our controls and procedures can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the above objectives have been met. 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a 15(f) or Rule 15d 15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended May 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
