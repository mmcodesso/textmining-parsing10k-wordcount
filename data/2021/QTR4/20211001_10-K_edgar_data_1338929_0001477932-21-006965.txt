Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has an accumulated deficit of 33,821,292 and 32,685,425 as of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively, which include net losses of 1,135,868 and 1,662,123 for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had a working capital deficit of 3,070,635 and 3,198,598 respectively, with limited cash resources available. Consequently, the aforementioned items raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Management plans to raise additional debt or equity and continue to settle obligations by issuing stock. Management plans to continue to raise additional debt and equity until the Company has positive cash flows from an operating company. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to repay or settle its current indebtedness, generate positive cash flow from an operating company, and/or raise capital through equity and debt financing or other means on desirable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain additional funds when they are required or if the funds cannot be obtained on favorable terms, management may be required to restructure the Company or cease operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the financial statements are prepared, and actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material. Due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. On a regular basis, we review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation our financial statements. Please refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as included in this Annual Report, for disclosures regarding the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates. 12 Table of Contents Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the valuation of common stock and options issued as stock based compensation. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from its contracts with customers in accordance with ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company recognizes revenues when satisfying the performance obligation of the associated contract that reflects the consideration expected to be received based on the terms of the contract. Revenue related to contracts with customers is evaluated utilizing the following steps: (i) Identify the contract, or contracts, with a customer; (ii) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) Determine the transaction price; (iv) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; (v) Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Leases Effective October 1, 2019, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board s (the FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ASU 2016-02 ), and additional ASUs issued to clarify and update the guidance in ASU 2016-02 (collectively, the new leases standard ), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new leases standard utilizing the modified retrospective transition method, under which amounts in prior periods presented were not restated. For contracts existing at the time of adoption, the Company elected to not reassess (i) whether any are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification, and (iii) initial direct costs. Upon adoption, the Company recorded 62,356 of right-of-use ROU assets and 62,356 of lease liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. Stock-based Compensation We account for stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation over the service-period that they are expected to vest. We estimate the fair value of stock options and stock purchase warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated value of the portion of a stock-based award that is ultimately expected to vest, taking into consideration estimated forfeitures, is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods. The model includes subjective input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates. The expected volatility is estimated based on the most recent historical period of time, of other comparative securities, equal to the weighted average life of the options. The estimate of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent that actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures, such differences are accounted for as a cumulative adjustment to compensation expenses and recorded in the period that estimates are revised. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred 700 and 83,574 for stock based compensation, respectively. 13 Table of Contents Fair Value FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure s ASC 820 establishes a framework for all fair value measurements and expands disclosures related to fair value measurement and developments. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 requires that assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1 Quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets or observable inputs; Level 2 Significant other observable inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data; and Level 3 Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data. The Company analyzed the conversion option for derivative accounting consideration under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and determined that the convertible notes should be classified as a liability since the conversion option becomes effective at issuance resulting in there being no explicit limit to the number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of the above conversion options. The Company accounts for convertible notes and warrants as a derivative liabilities due to there being no explicit limit to the number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of all conversion options. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, ASC Subtopic 470-20 Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options . The standard reduced the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting; and, (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this standard on its financial statements. Item 7A.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Da ta Boyle CPA, LLC Certified Public Accountants Consultants REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Global Fiber Technologies, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Global Fiber Technologies, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the two-years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Substantial Doubt About the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern . As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company s accumulated deficit, net loss and working capital deficiency raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of the financial statements. Management s plans are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis of Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Accounting for Embedded Derivative Liabilities Related to Convertible Debentures As described in Notes 4 and 5 to the financial statements, the Company had convertible debentures that required accounting considerations and significant estimates. The Company determined that variable conversion features issued in connection with certain convertible debentures required derivative liability classification. These variable conversion features were initially measured at fair value and subsequently have been remeasured to fair value at each reporting period. The Company determined the fair value of the embedded derivatives using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. We identified the accounting considerations and related valuations, including the related fair value determinations of the embedded derivative liabilities of such as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination were: (1) the accounting consideration in determining the nature of the various features (2) the evaluation of the potential derivatives and potential bifurcation in the instruments, and (3) considerations related to the determination of the fair value of the various debt and equity instruments and the conversion features that include valuation models and assumptions utilized by management. Auditing these elements is especially challenging and requires auditor judgement due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skill or knowledge needed. Our audit procedures related to management s conclusion on the evaluation and related valuation of embedded derivatives, included the following, among others: (1) evaluating the relevant terms and conditions of the various financings, (2) assessing the appropriateness of conclusions reached by the Company with respect to the accounting for the convertible debt, and the assessment and accounting for potential derivatives and (3) independently recomputing the valuations determined by Management. /s/ Boyle CPA, LLC We have served as the Company s auditor since 2020 Red Bank, NJ October 1, 2021 15 Table of Contents Global Fiber Technologies, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019 NOTE 1 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND GOING CONCERN Global Fiber Technologies, Inc. the Company was incorporated in Nevada on March 25, 2005. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had 400,000,000 shares of authorized common stock. On June 18, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of assets from AH Originals, Inc. AHO ), a corporation controlled by the same owner group of Global Fiber Technologies, Inc., for the consideration of 6,400,000 shares of common stock of the Company to be issued and the issuance of a promissory note of 447,150 that bears 3 interest per annum and have a one year term with eight options to extend the maturity date for three-month periods. In addition, the Company issued to AHO 200,000 common shares of Authentic Heroes, Inc. AHI ), a subsidiary created by the Company, to hold the purchased assets. AHI has commenced minimal operations as of December 31, 2019. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has an accumulated deficit of 33,821,292 and 32,685,425 as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, which include net losses of 1,135,868 and 1,662,123 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had a working capital deficit of 3,070,635 and 3,198,598 respectively, with limited cash resources available. Consequently, the aforementioned items raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Management plans to raise additional debt or equity and continue to settle obligations by issuing stock. Management plans to continue to raise additional debt and equity until the Company has positive cash flows from an operating company. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to repay or settle its current indebtedness, generate positive cash flow from an operating company, and/or raise capital through equity and debt financing or other means on desirable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain additional funds when they are required or if the funds cannot be obtained on favorable terms, management may be required to restructure the Company or cease operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and has adopted a December 31 fiscal year end. 20 Table of Contents Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, ECO CHAIN 360, Inc. which are 51 owned. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. As noted above in Note 1, our 51 owned subsidiary had no operations, assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Because of this, a non-controlling interest is not reflected in these financial statements. In addition, the Company has consolidated Authentic Heroes, Inc., Inc. of which the Company owns 80 . Reclassifications Certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported consolidated net loss. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and investments in money market funds. The Company considers all highly-liquid instruments with an original maturity of 90 days or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. On December 31, 2020, the Company acquired inventories from AH Originals, Inc. for an aggregate amount of 60,815. December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Raw Material 13,631 13,631 Finished Goods 47,184 47,184 60,815 60,815 21 Table of Contents Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Costs of replacements and major improvements are capitalized, and maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation expense is provided primarily by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: Equipment 5 Years Furniture and Fixtures 7 Years Forklift 3 Years December 31, December 31, 2020 2019 Furniture and Equipment 216,398 218,315 Forklift 20,433 20,433 236,681 238,748 Less accumulated depreciation (73,738 (25,711 163,093 213,037 Depreciation expense amounted to 49,944 and 24,174 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. On June 18, 2019, the Company acquired equipment from AH Originals, Inc. for an aggregate amount of 214,598. The long-lived assets of the Company are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment ASC 360 ), whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, no impairment losses have been identified. 22 Table of Contents Intangible Assets The Company accounts for intangible assets (including trademarks and website) in accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ASC 350 ). ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value. In addition, ASC 350 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis and between annual tests when circumstances indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill may be in doubt. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units; assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions or the occurrence of one or more confirming events in future periods could cause the actual results or outcomes to materially differ from such estimates and could also affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment at future reporting dates. The cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, either on a straight-line or accelerated basis over the estimated periods benefited. Patents, technology and other intangibles with contractual terms are generally amortized over their respective legal or contractual lives. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted. On June 18, 2019, the Company acquired intangible assets from AH Originals, Inc. for an aggregate amount of 16,200, which includes website of 10,690 and patent of 5,510. We amortize the cost of our intangible assets over the 15-year estimated useful life on a straight-line basis. The following table sets forth the amortization for the intangible assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019: December 31, December 31, 2020 2019 Patent 12,406 9,233 Websites 10,690 10,690 Royalties 125,000 50,000 148,096 69,923 Less accumulated amortization (18,634 (639 129,462 69,284 Amortization expense amounted to 49,944 and 639 for the year ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. 23 Table of Contents Prepaid interest and deposits Prepaid interest and deposits consist of prepaid consulting fees, OTC market annual fees and license agreement. Prepaid interest is amortized over the life of the related liability. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from its contracts with customers in accordance with ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company recognizes revenues when satisfying the performance obligation of the associated contract that reflects the consideration expected to be received based on the terms of the contract. Revenue related to contracts with customers is evaluated utilizing the following steps: (i) Identify the contract, or contracts, with a customer; (ii) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) Determine the transaction price; (iv) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; (v) Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are recorded in accordance with ASC 310, Receivables. Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. The Company does not currently have any amount recorded as an allowance for doubtful accounts. Based on management s estimate and based on all accounts being current, the Company has not deemed it necessary to reserve for doubtful accounts at this time. Leases Effective October 1, 2019, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board s (the FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ASU 2016-02 ), and additional ASUs issued to clarify and update the guidance in ASU 2016-02 (collectively, the new leases standard ), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new leases standard utilizing the modified retrospective transition method, under which amounts in prior periods presented were not restated. For contracts existing at the time of adoption, the Company elected to not reassess (i) whether any are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification, and (iii) initial direct costs. Upon adoption, the Company recorded 62,356 of right-of-use ROU assets and 62,356 of lease liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method as stipulated by ASC 740 Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities or a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced to estimated amounts to be realized by the use of a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is applied when in management s view it is more likely than not that such deferred tax asset will be unable to be utilized. 24 Table of Contents The Company adopted certain provisions under ASC Topic 740, which provide interpretative guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Effective with the Company s adoption of these provisions, interest related to the unrecognized tax benefits is recognized in the financial statements as a component of income taxes. In the unlikely event that an uncertain tax position exists in which the Company could incur income taxes, the Company would evaluate whether there is a probability that the uncertain tax position taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. Reserves for uncertain tax positions would be recorded if the Company determined it is probable that a position would not be sustained upon examination or if payment would have to be made to a taxing authority and the amount is reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company does not believe it has any uncertain tax positions that would result in the Company having a liability to the taxing authorities. The Company s tax returns are subject to examination by the federal and state tax authorities for the years ended 2007 through 2020. Stock-based Compensation We account for stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant, and recognize compensation over the service-period that they are expected to vest. We estimate the fair value of stock options and stock purchase warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated value of the portion of a stock-based award that is ultimately expected to vest, taking into consideration estimated forfeitures, is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods. The model includes subjective input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates. The expected volatility is estimated based on the most recent historical period of time, of other comparative securities, equal to the weighted average life of the options. The estimate of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent that actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures, such differences are accounted for as a cumulative adjustment to compensation expenses and recorded in the period that estimates are revised. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred 700 and 83,574 for stock based compensation, respectively. Beneficial Conversion Feature For conventional convertible debt where the rate of conversion is below market value, the Company records any beneficial conversion feature BCF intrinsic value as additional paid in capital and related debt discount. When the Company records a BCF, the relative fair value of the BCF is recorded as a debt discount against the face amount of the respective debt instrument. The discount is amortized over the life of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed. Debt Issue Costs The Company may pay debt issue costs in connection with raising funds through the issuance of debt whether convertible or not or with other consideration. These costs are recorded as debt discounts and are amortized over the life of the debt to the statement of operations as amortization of debt discount. 25 Table of Contents Original Issue Discount If debt is issued with an original issue discount, the original issue discount is recorded to debt discount, reducing the face amount of the note and is amortized over the life of the debt to the statement of operations as amortization of debt discount. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed. Use of Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the valuation of stock based awards issued and derivatives embedded in financial instruments. Estimates are used in the determination of depreciation, the valuation of non-cash issuances of common stock, stock options and warrants, valuing convertible notes for beneficial conversion features, among others. Fair Value FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure s ASC 820 establishes a framework for all fair value measurements and expands disclosures related to fair value measurement and developments. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 requires that assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1 Quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets or observable inputs; Level 2 Significant other observable inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data; and Level 3 Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data. The following table summarizes fair value measurements by level at December 31, 2020, and 2019, measured at fair value on a recurring basis: December 31, 2020 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Liabilities Derivative Liabilities - - 620,149 620,149 December 31, 2019 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Liabilities Derivative Liabilities - - 989,813 989,813 26 Table of Contents Concentration of Credit Risk The carrying value of short-term financial instruments, including cash, restricted cash, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and short-term debt, approximates the fair value of these instruments. These financial instruments generally expose the Company to limited credit risk and have no stated maturities or have short-term maturities and carry interest rates that approximate market. The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions that are insured by the FDIC. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had no amounts in excess of the FDIC limit. COVID-19 The Company s operations and business have experienced disruption due to the unprecedented conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic spreading throughout the United States and the world and thus the Company s business operations have been disrupted and it is unable to timely review and prepare the Company s financial statements for the 2020 fiscal year. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has and is continuing to spread throughout China and other parts of the world, including the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a pandemic . Our operations are in Somerset, NJ which NJ as a whole is characterized as an area that has a high concentration of risk as it relates to COVID-19. The Company has been following the recommendations of local health authorities to minimize exposure risk for its employees for the past several weeks, including the temporary closures of its offices and having employees work remotely to the extent possible, which has to an extent adversely affected their efficiency. As a result, the Company s books and records were not easily accessible, resulting in delays in preparation and completion of its financial statements. Further, the various governmental mandatory closures of businesses in these locations have precluded the Company s personnel, particularly its senior accounting staff, from obtaining access to its subsidiaries books and records necessary to prepare the Company s financial statements that, once audited, comprise the essence of the Annual Report. New Accounting Pronouncements In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, ASC Subtopic 470-20 Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options . The standard reduced the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting; and, (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this standard on its financial statements.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure There were no disagreements related to accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, internal controls or auditing scope or procedure during the two fiscal years and interim periods. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation Of Disclosure Controls And Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer (our chief executive officer), we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 , as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the material information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officer, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms relating to our company, particularly during the period when this report was being prepared. Management s Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, for our company. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, and accordingly, even effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect material misstatements. In addition, effective internal control at a point in time may become ineffective in future periods because of changes in conditions or due to deterioration in the degree of compliance with our established policies and procedures. A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in there being a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Under the supervision and with the participation of our president and our chief executive officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2019, based on the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation under this framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the evaluation date due to the factors stated below. 37 Table of Contents Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of evaluation date and identified the following material weaknesses: Insufficient Resources : We have an inadequate number of personnel with requisite expertise in the key functional areas of finance and accounting. Inadequate Segregation Of Duties : We have an inadequate number of personnel to properly implement control procedures. Lack Of Audit Committee: We do not have a functioning audit committee resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures. Management is committed to improving its internal controls and will (1) continue to use third party specialists to address shortfalls in staffing and to assist the Company with accounting and finance responsibilities, (2) increase the frequency of independent reconciliations of significant accounts which will mitigate the lack of segregation of duties until there are sufficient personnel and (3) may consider appointing an audit committee members in the future. Management, including our president and our chief executive officer, have discussed the material weakness noted above with our independent registered public accounting firm. Due to the nature of this material weakness, there is a more than remote likelihood that misstatements which could be material to the annual or interim financial statements could occur that would not be prevented or detected. This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. Changes In Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Giordano. We have determined that Scott Todd, Paul Serbiak, and Christopher H. Giordano are independent directors, as that term is used in Rule 4200(a)(15) of the Rules of National Association of Securities Dealers. Currently our audit committee consists of our entire board of directors. We currently do not have nominating, compensation committees or committees performing similar functions. There has not been any defined policy or procedure requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nomination for directors.

All of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by the board of directors either before or after the respective services were rendered. Our board of directors has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by our independent auditors and believes that the provision of services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining our independent auditors independence. 47 Table of Contents PART IV Item 15.
