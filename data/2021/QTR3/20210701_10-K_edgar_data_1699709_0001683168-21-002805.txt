Forward-looking statements

historical or current facts are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933 (the Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements often can be identified
by the use of terms such as may, will, expect, believe, anticipate, estimate, 
 approximate or continue, or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to
the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future.
However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual
results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected.
We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of
such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. 

Financial information contained in this report
and in our financial statements is stated in United States dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles. 

Corporate Overview 

Yijia Group Corp. (the Company ,
 we , us was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 25, 2017 and has a fiscal year that ends on April
30. The company s former name was Soldino Group Corp. We are a development-stage company formed to commence operations in the manufacturing
and distribution of work wear. We ceased and discontinued our operations in the second fiscal quarter of 2018. As such, we accounted
for all of our assets, liabilities and results of operations up to October 31, 2018 as discontinued operations. 

We do not have any subsidiaries. 

We have never declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or been involved
in any kind of legal proceedings. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation
of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company currently has no operations and as of April 30, 2021 had a stockholders deficit
of 174,670. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The
accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Business 

Currently, we have no active operations. 

Research and Development 

We have not incurred any research and development
costs in the fiscal years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020. 

Insurance 

We do not maintain insurance and do not intend
to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have insurance, if we are made a party to any action, we may not have sufficient
funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations. 

1 

Employees 

We are a development stage company and currently have no employees. 

Offices 

Our office is located at Unit 1623, Tianxia International
Center B, Taoyuan Road, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, Guangdong, PRC. Our telephone number is +86 0755 3397 5792 

Government Regulation 

We will be required to comply with all regulations,
rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to export and import of work wear and operation of any facility
in any jurisdiction in which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that government regulation will have a material impact on
the way we conduct our business. We do not need to receive any government approvals to conduct our business. However, we will have to
comply with all applicable export and import regulations should we recommence our operations. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff
Comments 

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

Item 2. Description
of Property

us.

PART II 

Item 5. Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder
Matters 

Market Information 

During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021,
our common stock was quoted on the OTC under the symbol YJGJ with no bid and no trading of our common stock. There can be no assurance
that a public trading market will develop or be sustained in the future. Without an active public trading market, you may not be able
to liquidate your shares without considerable delay, if at all. If a market does develop, the price for our securities may be highly volatile
and may bear no relationship to our actual financial condition or results of operations. The many risks associated with an investment
in our company, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock. Also, because there is no price for our common
stock, many brokerage firms may not affect transactions in the common stock. 

Number of Holders 

As of July 1, 2021, 5,871,250 issued and outstanding
shares of common stock were held by a total of seven shareholders of record. 

Dividends 

No cash dividends were paid on our shares of common
stock during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021. 

Transfer Agent and Registrar 

The transfer agent and registrar for
the Company s common stock is Action Stock Transfer Corporation at 2469 E. Fort Union Blvd, Suite 214 Salt Lake City, UT 84121.
The telephone number is: (801) 274-1088. 

Equity Compensation Plan Information 

We do not have any equity compensation plans and
accordingly we have no shares authorized for issuance under an equity compensation plan. 

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities 

We did not sell any equity securities which were
not registered under the Securities Act during the year ended April 30, 2021 that were not otherwise disclosed on our quarterly reports
on Form 10-Q or our current reports on Form 8-K filed during the year ended April 30, 2021. 

Purchase of our Equity Securities by Officers
and Directors 

We did not purchase any of our shares of common
stock or other securities during our fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended April 30, 2021.

None.

Item 7. Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction
with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains
forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those
discussed in the forward-looking statements. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared
in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis
or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing,
includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. 

We qualify as an emerging growth company 
under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long
as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to: have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting
pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; provide an auditor attestation with respect to management s report on the
effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting; comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional
information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis); submit certain executive compensation
matters to shareholders advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency and disclose certain executive
compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation
to median employee compensation. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage
of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. 

We have elected to take advantage of the benefits
of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such
new or revised accounting standards. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest
of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed 1 billion, (ii) the date that we become
a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market
value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed
second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three
year period. Even if we no longer qualify for the exemptions for an emerging growth company, we may still be, in certain circumstances,
subject to scaled disclosure requirements as a smaller reporting company. For example, smaller reporting companies, like emerging growth
companies, are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis under Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K or auditor attestation
of internal controls over financial reporting. 

Results of operations 

We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our
financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments
relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable
to continue in operation. 

We will require additional capital to meet our
long term operating goals. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. 

Results of operation for the years ended April 30, 2021 and April
30, 2020: 

Revenue 

There was no revenue and cost of sales for the
years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020. Operating expenses for the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020 were 52,094 and 72,334, respectively. 

4 

Net Loss 

The net loss for the years ended April 30, 2021
and 2020 was 52,094 and 72,334 accordingly. 

Liquidity and capital resources 

As of April 30, 2021 and 2020, our total assets
were 0. 

As of April 30, 2021, our current liabilities
were 174,670 122,576 as of April 30, 2020) and stockholders deficit was 174,670 122,576 as of April 30, 2020). 

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES 

For the year ended April 30, 2021, we have not
generated positive cash flows from operating activities. Net cash flows used in operating activities was 42,286, which consisted of increase
in accruals and other payables. 

For the year ended April 30, 2020, we have not
generated positive cash flows from operating activities. Net cash flow used in operating activities was 53,579, which consisted of increase
in accruals and other payables. 

CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES 

For the year ended April 30, 2021, net cash flow
provided by financing activities was 42,286 from proceeds from a related party. 

For the year ended April 30, 2020, net cash flow
provided by financing activities was 53,579 from proceeds from a related party. 

Our cash balance is 0 as of April 30, 2021. We
believe our cash balance is insufficient to fund our operations for any period of time. Management anticipates that the Company will be
dependent, in the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends to position itself so
that it will be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management s efforts, there are no assurances
that the Company will be successful. 

Limited operating history; need for additional
capital 

There is no historical financial information about
us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in a start-up stage of operations and have generated limited revenues since
inception. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the
establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases
in services and products. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company does not have any off balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and 

 Stockholders of Yijia Group Corp. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Yijia Group Corp. (the
 Company as of April 30, 2021 and 2020, and the related statements of operations, of changes in stockholders 
deficit, and of cash flows for the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred
to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of April 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Consideration of the Company s Ability
to Continue as a Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has
suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits of these financial
statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express
no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Exelient PAC 

We have served as the Company s auditor
since 2019.

YIJIA GROUP CORP. 

 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 FOR THE YEARS ENDED APRIL 30, 2021 AND 2020 

Note 1 ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF
BUSINESS 

Yijia Group Corp. the Company ,
 we , us or our was incorporated as Soldino Group Corp. on January 25, 2017 under the laws of
the State of Nevada, United States of America. The Company has ceased its operations as of October 2018. As such, the Company accounted
for all of its assets, liabilities and results of operations up to October 31, 2018 as discontinued operations. As of November 1, 2018,
the Company is a shell company. On November 15, 2018, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation with
Nevada s Secretary of State to change its name to Yijia Group Corp. 

On October 31, 2018, Aurora Fiorin resigned as
the President, Treasurer, Secretary and Director of the Company. Ms. Fiorin s resignation as President, Treasurer and Secretary
was effective immediately. Ms. Fiorin s resignation as a Director was effective ten (10) days following the filing by the Company
of the Information Statement on Schedule 14f-1 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Prior
to Ms. Fiorin s resignation, she appointed Ms. Shaoyin Wu as the new President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Mr.
Kim Lee Poh as the Company s new Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. Messrs. Wu and Poh were appointed as new board members of
the Company together with Mr. Jian Yang. 

Note 2 GOING CONCERN 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.
The Company incurred net loss of 52,094 for the year ended April 30, 2021 and an accumulated deficit of 239,365. 

Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern without future profitability. Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent,
in the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends to position itself so that it will
be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. 

In light of management s efforts, there
are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going
concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets
and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to
the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Note 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES 

Basis of presentation 

 The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The Company s fiscal year
is April 30.

YIJIA GROUP CORP. 

 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 FOR THE YEARS ENDED APRIL 30, 2021 AND 2020 

Use of Estimates 

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

 Accounting Standards Codification ASC topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs
in measuring fair value. The hierarchy organizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair
value are observable in the market. 

These tiers include: 

Level 1: 
 defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 
 
 Level 2: 
 defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; 
 
 Level 3: 
 defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 

The carrying value of cash and the Company s
loan from shareholders approximates its fair value due to their short-term maturity. 

Income Taxes 

 Income taxes are computed using the asset and
liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws.
A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. 

Uncertain Tax Positions 

The Company did not take any uncertain tax positions
and had no adjustments to its income tax liabilities or benefits pursuant to the ASC 740 provisions of Section 740-10-25 for the years
ended April 30, 2021 and 2020.

YIJIA GROUP CORP. 

 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 FOR THE YEARS ENDED APRIL 30, 2021 AND 2020 

Revenue Recognition 

 The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with
ASC No. 605, Revenue Recognition ASC-605 ). ASC-605 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue
can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable;
and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding the
fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates
to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded.
The Company will defer any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company
and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required. For the years ended April 30, 2021
and 2020, no revenues were generated. 

Net Loss Per Share 

 The Company computes net loss per share in accordance
with FASB ASC 260 Earnings per Share . Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders
by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential
common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.
As of April 30, 2021 and 2020, there were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued or outstanding. 

Currencies 

 The Company s reporting and functional currencies
are both the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other income (expense) but are negligible. 

Comprehensive Income 

 Comprehensive income is defined as all changes
in stockholders deficit, exclusive of transactions with owners, such as capital investments. Comprehensive income includes net
income or loss, changes in certain assets and liabilities that are reported directly in equity such as translation adjustments on investments
in foreign subsidiaries and unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities. As of April 30, 2021 and 2020, there were no differences
between our comprehensive loss and net loss. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

 Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair
value in accordance with ASC Topic 718. The amendments in Update expand the scope of Topic 718 to include share based payment transactions
for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. An entity should apply the requirements of Topic 718 to nonemployee awards except
for specific guidance on inputs to an option pricing model and the attribution of cost (that is, the period of time over which share-based
payment awards vest and the pattern of cost recognition over that period). The amendments specify that Topic 718 applies to all share-based
payment transactions in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantor s own operations by issuing
share-based payment awards. The amendments also clarify that Topic 718 does not apply to share-based payments used to effectively provide
(1) financing to the issuer or (2) awards granted in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted
for under Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted
any stock options. 

Related parties 

 Parties, which can be a corporation or individual,
are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant
influence over the party in making financial and operational decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject
to common control or common significant influence.

Reclassification 

 Certain reclassifications have been made to the
financial statements for the prior year periods to present that information on a basis consistent with the current period. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

 From time to time, new accounting pronouncements
are issued by the Financial Accounting Standard Board FASB or other standard setting bodies and adopted by the Company
as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes that the impact of recently issued standards that
are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations upon adoption. 

Simplifying the Accounting
for Debt with Conversion and Other Options. 

In June 2020, the FASB
issued ASU 2020-06 to simplify the accounting in ASC 470, Debt with Conversion and Other Options and ASC 815, Contracts
in Equity s Own Entity . The guidance simplifies the current guidance for convertible instruments and the derivatives
scope exception for contracts in an entity s own equity. Additionally, the amendments affect the diluted EPS calculation for instruments
that may be settled in cash or shares and for convertible instruments. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of the
Company s fiscal year 2022. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update must be applied on either full retrospective
basis or modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings/(deficit) in the period of adoption.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2020-06 on its financial statements and related disclosures, as well as the timing
of adoption. 

Financial Instruments 

In June 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ASU 2016-13 ), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. In February
2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-02 and delayed the effective date of ASU 2016-13 until fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2022. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13 on its financial statements. 

Simplifying the Accounting
for Income Taxes 

In December 2019, the
FASB issued ASU 2019-12 to simplify the accounting in ASC 740, Income Taxes . This guidance removes certain exceptions
related to the approach for intra-period tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition
of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. This guidance also clarifies and simplifies other areas of ASC 740. This ASU
will be effective beginning in the first quarter of the Company s fiscal year 2021. Early adoption is permitted. Certain amendments
in this update must be applied on a prospective basis, certain amendments must be applied on a retrospective basis, and certain amendments
must be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings/(deficit) in the period
of adoption. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 does not have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements as of and for
the year ended April 30, 2021. 

Earnings Per Share 

In April 2021, the FASB
issued ASU 2021-04, which included Topic 260 Earnings Per Share . This guidance clarifies and reduces diversity in
an issuer s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options due to a lack of explicit
guidance in the FASB Codification. The ASU 2021-04 is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early
adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2021-04 on its financial statements.

Note 5 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

As of April 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company has
no material commitments or contingencies. 

Note 6 INCOME TAXES 

The Company adopted the provisions of uncertain
tax positions as addressed in ASC 740-10-65-1. As a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10-65-1, the Company recognized no increase
in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. 

The Company has no tax position at April 30, 2021
for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. The
Company does not recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses.
No such interest or penalties were recognized during the period presented. The Company had no accruals for interest and penalties at April
30, 2021 and 2020. The Company s utilization of any net operating loss carry forward may be unlikely as a result of its intended
activities.

YIJIA GROUP CORP. 

 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 FOR THE YEARS ENDED APRIL 30, 2021 AND 2020 

The valuation allowance at April 30, 2021 and
2020 was 50,267 and 39,327. The net change in valuation allowance during the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020 was 10,940 and 15,191.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation
of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled
reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based
on consideration of these items, management has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred
income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance as of April 30, 2021 and 2020. All tax years
since inception remains open for examination only by taxing authorities of US Federal and state of Nevada. 

The Company has a net operating loss carryforward
for tax purposes totaling 239,365 and 187,271 at April 30, 2021 and 2020, expiring through 2041. There is a limitation on the amount
of taxable income that can be offset by carryforwards after a change in control (generally greater than a 50 change in ownership). Temporary
differences, which give rise to a net deferred tax asset, are as follows:

Item 9. Changes In and Disagreements

None. 

Item 9A Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

The Company maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Company s Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

The Company s management, with the participation
of our principal executive and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial
officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective. 

Management s Report on Internal Controls
over Financial Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and
with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2021 using the criteria established
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tread way
Commission COSO ). 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2021, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies
that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 

1. 
 We do not have an Audit Committee While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company s financial statement. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management s activities. 

2. 
 We did not maintain appropriate cash controls As of April 30, 2021, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signature on the Company s bank accounts. Alternatively, the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the Company had limited transactions in their bank accounts. 

3. 
 We did not implement appropriate information technology controls As at April 30, 2021, the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors. 

19 

Accordingly, the Company concluded that these
control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Company s internal controls. 

As a result of the material weaknesses described
above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 30,
2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 

System of Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that
is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management,
including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision
and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of April 30, 2021. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There was no change in the Company s internal
control over financial reporting during the quarterly period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

Item 9B. Other Information. 

None.

to a related party of 146,107 and 103,821 represents temporary advances by the director, Shaoyin
Wu of the Company, which is unsecured, interest-free and has no fixed terms of repayment. 

Director Independence 

We have adopted standards for director independence
that correspond to NASDAQ listing standards and SEC rules. An independent director means a person who is not an officer
or employee of the Company or its subsidiaries, or any other individual having a relationship that, in the opinion of the Board, would
interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. To be considered independent,
the Board must affirmatively determine that neither the director, nor any member of his or her immediate family, has had any direct or
indirect material relationship with the Company within the previous three years. In addition, to be considered independent 
under SEC rules, each member of the Audit Committee may not accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory
fee from us, other than compensation for his or her services as a director 

The Board considered relationships, transactions
and/or arrangements with each of the directors and concluded that none of the non-employee directors, or any of his or her immediate family
members, has any relationship with us that would impair his or her independence. The Board has determined that each member of the Board,
is not an independent director under applicable NASDAQ listing standards and SEC rules. 

Item 14. Principal Accountant
Fees and Services 

Our Board of Directors has not yet adopted pre-approval
policies and procedures but considers all matters brought before it. We expect to adopt such policies and procedures after the formation
of our Audit Committee.

The aggregate professional fees paid to our registered
public accounting firm for its annual audit and quarterly reviews during the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:
