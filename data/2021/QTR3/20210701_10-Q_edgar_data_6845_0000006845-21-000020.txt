 Receivables 
 Receivables reflected in the financial statements represent the net amount expected to be collected. An allowance for credit losses is established based on expected losses. Expected losses are estimated by reviewing individual accounts, considering aging, financial condition of the debtor, recent payment history, current and forecast economic conditions and other relevant factors. Upon billing, aging of receivables is monitored until collection. An account is considered current when it is within agreed upon payment terms. An account is written off when it is determined that the asset is no longer collectible. Retainage on construction contracts represents amounts withheld by our customers on long-term projects until the project reaches a level of completion where amounts are released.

Contract assets and liabilities 
 Contract assets consist of retainage, costs and earnings in excess of billings and other unbilled amounts typically generated when revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. Contract liabilities consist of billings in excess of costs and earnings and other deferred revenue on contracts. Retainage is classified within receivables and deferred revenue is classified within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 The time period between when performance obligations are complete and when payment is due is not significant. In certain of our businesses that recognize revenue over time, progress billings follow an agreed-upon schedule of values, and retainage is withheld by the customer until the project reaches a level of completion where amounts are released. 
 Contract liabilities 
 
 The change in contract assets and contract liabilities was mainly due to timing of project activity within our businesses that operate under long-term contracts. 
 Other contract-related disclosures Three Months Ended (In thousands) May 29, 2021 May 30, 2020 Revenue recognized related to contract liabilities from prior year-end Revenue recognized related to prior satisfaction of performance obligations 
 
 Some of our contracts have an expected duration of longer than a year, with performance obligations extending over that timeframe. Generally, these contracts are in our businesses with long-term contracts which recognize revenue over time. As of May 29, 2021, the transaction price associated with unsatisfied performance obligations was approximately million.

 Derivative instruments 
 We use interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, commodity swaps and forward purchase contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations. The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments we use, how such instruments are accounted for, and how such instruments impact our financial position and performance. 
 
 In fiscal 2020, we entered into an interest rate swap to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows from interest payments on our floating-rate revolving credit facility and term loan. As of May 29, 2021, the interest rate swap contract had a notional value of million. 
 
 We periodically enter into forward purchase contracts and/or fixed/floating swaps to manage the risk associated with fluctuations in aluminum prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates (primarily related to the Canadian dollar). These contracts generally have an original maturity date of less than one year. As of May 29, 2021, we held foreign exchange forward contracts and aluminum fixed/floating swaps with U.S. dollar notional values of million and million, respectively. 
 
 These derivative instruments are recorded within our consolidated balance sheets within other current assets and liabilities. Gains or losses associated with these instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. 
 
 Fair value measurements 
 Financial assets and liabilities are classified in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement: Level 1 (unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities); Level 2 (observable market inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1); and Level 3 (unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data). We do not have any Level 3 financial assets or liabilities.

The error was not material to any previously reported annual or interim consolidated financial statements. 

Other intangible assets 
 We have intangible assets for certain acquired trade names and trademarks which are determined to have indefinite useful lives. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually at the same measurement date as goodwill, the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. Based on our analysis, the fair value of each of our trade names and trademarks exceeded carrying amount,

 million with a maturity of June 2024. There were outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of May 29, 2021 and February 27, 2021. At May 29, 2021 and February 27, 2021, we also had a million term loan with a maturity date of June 2024. 
 
 Our revolving credit facility and term loan contain two financial covenants that require us to stay below a maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratio and maintain a minimum ratio of interest expense-to-EBITDA. Both ratios are computed quarterly, with EBITDA calculated on a rolling four-quarter basis. At May 29, 2021, we were in compliance with both financial covenants. Additionally, at May 29, 2021, we had a total of million of ongoing letters of credit related to industrial revenue bonds, construction contracts and insurance collateral that expire in fiscal years 2022 to 2023 and reduce borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility. 
 
 At May 29, 2021, debt included million of industrial revenue bonds that mature in fiscal years 2022 through 2043. The fair value of the industrial revenue bonds approximated carrying value at May 29, 2021, due to the variable interest rates on these instruments. All debt would be classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy described in Note 4. 
 
 We also maintain two Canadian committed, revolving credit facilities totaling million (USD). As of May 29, 2021 and February 27, 2021, there were borrowings outstanding under the facilities.

 billion of these types of bonds were outstanding, of which million is in our backlog. These bonds do not have stated expiration dates. We have never been required to make payments under surety or performance bonds with respect to our existing businesses. 
 
 Warranty and project-related contingencies 
 We reserve estimated exposures on known claims, as well as on a portion of anticipated claims, for product warranty and rework cost, based on historical product liability claims as a ratio of sales. Claim costs are deducted from the accrual when paid. Factors that could have an impact on the warranty accrual in any given period include the following: changes in manufacturing quality, changes in product mix and any significant changes in sales volume. 
 Additional accruals Claims paid ) ) Balance at end of period 
 
 Additionally, we are subject to project management and installation-related contingencies as a result of our fixed-price material supply and installation service contracts, primarily in our Architectural Services segment and certain of our Architectural Framing Systems businesses. We manage the risk of these exposures through contract negotiations, proactive project management and insurance coverages. The liability for these types of project-related contingencies was million and million as of May 29, 2021 and February 27, 2021, respectively. 
 
 Letters of credit 
 At May 29, 2021, we had million of ongoing letters of credit, all of which have been issued under our committed revolving credit facility, as discussed in Note 6. We also have a 6.9 million letter of credit which has been issued outside our committed revolving credit facility, with no impact on our borrowing capacity and debt covenants. 
 
 Purchase obligations 
 Purchase obligations for raw material commitments and capital expenditures totaled million as of May 29, 2021. 
 
 New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) transactions 
 We have three outstanding NMTC arrangements which help to support operational expansion. Proceeds received from investors on these transactions are included within other non-current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The NMTC arrangements are subject to 100 percent tax credit recapture for a period of seven years from the date of each respective transaction. Upon the termination of each arrangement, these proceeds will be recognized in earnings in exchange for the transfer of tax credits. The direct and incremental costs incurred in structuring these arrangements have been deferred and are included in other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. These costs will be recognized in conjunction with the recognition of the related proceeds on each arrangement. During the construction phase for each project, we are required to hold cash dedicated to fund each capital project which is classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets. Variable-interest entities, which have been included within our consolidated financial statements, have been created as a result of the structure of these transactions, as investors in the programs do not have a material interest in their underlying economics. 
 
 The table below provides a summary of our outstanding NMTC transactions (in millions):

 Executive Compensation Program 
 In fiscal 2022, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors implemented an executive compensation program for certain key employees. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we issued performance shares in the form of nonvested share unit awards, which give the recipient the right to receive shares earned at the vesting date. The number of share units issued at grant is equal to the target number of performance shares and allows for the right to receive an additional number of shares dependent on achieving a defined performance goal of return on invested capital and being employed at the end of the performance period.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Forward-looking statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the section Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. The words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, forecast, project, should, "will," "continue" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All forecasts and projections in this document are forward-looking statements, and are based on management s current expectations or beliefs. From time to time, we may also provide oral and written forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the public, such as press releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, or other communications by the Company. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this report and in any public statements we make could be materially different from actual results. 
 
 Accordingly, we wish to caution investors that any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Information about factors that could materially affect our results can be found in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 27, 2021 and in subsequent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 We also wish to caution investors that other factors might in the future prove to be important in affecting the Company s results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time; it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

Overview 
 We are a leader in the design and development of value-added glass and metal products and services for enclosing commercial buildings and framing and displays. Our four reporting segments are: Architectural Framing Systems, Architectural Glass, Architectural Services and Large-Scale Optical (LSO). 
 
 The following selected financial data should be read in conjunction with the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended February 27, 2021 and the consolidated financial statements, including the notes to consolidated financial statements, included therein. 

Highlights of First Quarter of Fiscal 2022 Compared to First Quarter of Fiscal 2021 
 
 Net sales 
 Consolidated net sales increased 12.8 percent, or 36.9 million, for the three-month period ended May 29, 2021, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by volume growth in the LSO, Architectural Services and Architectural Glass segments. LSO was closed for most of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, due to COVID-19. 
 
 The relationship between various components of operations, as a percentage of net sales, is presented below: 
 Three Months Ended May 29, 2021 May 30, 2020 Net sales 100.0 100.0 Cost of sales 79.2 79.2 Gross margin 20.8 20.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 15.8 18.6 Operating income 4.9 2.2 Interest expense, net 0.4 0.5 Other income, net 0.1 0.4 Earnings before income taxes 4.4 1.4 Income tax expense 1.1 0.4 Net earnings 3.3 1.0 Effective tax rate 25.3 28.2

Table of Contents 

 Gross profit 
 Gross profit as a percent of sales (gross margin) was 20.8 percent in each of the three-month periods ended May 29, 2021 and May 30, 2020. Gross margin was positively impacted by strong recovery of the LSO segment (which closed for most of the first quarter last year to comply with COVID-related directives) and improved margins in the Architectural Glass segment, which offset margin declines within the Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Services segments. Each of our segments experienced inflation in operating costs, especially freight and materials costs, during the quarter. While we are undertaking measures to offset these costs, we expect this trend to continue through fiscal 2022. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses 
 SG A expenses as a percent of sales were 15.8 percent for the three-month period ended May 29, 2021, compared to 18.6 percent for the prior year three-month period. SG A decreased as a percent of sales compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to ongoing well controlled spending across all segments of the business, as well as a benefit of 2.7 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, from a Canadian wage subsidy program offered to support Canadian businesses due to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 Income tax expense 
 The effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was 25.3 percent, compared to 28.2 percent in the same period last year, primarily due to favorable provisions in the Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") impacting the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and the negative impact of unfavorable permanent items in relation to reduced earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. 

Segment Analysis 
 
 Architectural Framing Systems 
 Three Months Ended (In thousands) May 29, 2021 May 30, 2020 Change Net sales 151,840 150,164 1.1 Operating income 8,060 7,296 10.5 Operating margin 5.3 4.9 
 Architectural Framing Systems net sales increased 1.7 million, or 1.1 percent, for the three-month period ended May 29, 2021, compared to the prior-year period, primarily reflecting improved pricing. This improvement was partially offset by unfavorable project performance and mix, compared to the prior-year period. 
 
 Operating margin increased 40 basis points for the three-month period of the current year, compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting benefits from cost-saving actions, which offset increased costs for materials and freight. In addition, this segment benefited from a Canadian wage subsidy of 2.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, as a result of a program to support Canadian businesses due to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 As of May 29, 2021, segment backlog was approximately 423 million, compared to approximately 411 million at the end of the prior quarter, and 421 million at the end of the first quarter of the prior year. Backlog represents the dollar amount of signed contracts or firm orders, generally as a result of a competitive bidding process, which may be expected to be recognized as revenue in the future. Backlog is not a term defined under U.S. GAAP and is not a measure of contract profitability. We view backlog as one indicator of future revenues, particularly in our longer-lead time businesses. In addition to backlog, we have a substantial amount of projects with short lead times that book-and-bill within the same reporting period and are not included in backlog. We have strong visibility beyond backlog, as projects awarded, verbal commitments and bidding activities are not included in backlog. 
 
 Architectural Glass 
 Three Months Ended (In thousands) May 29, 2021 May 30, 2020 Change Net sales 83,031 76,911 8.0 Operating income 2,128 (494) N/M Operating margin 2.6 (0.6) 
 Net sales increased 6.1 million, or 8.0 percent, for the three-month period ended May 29, 2021, compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by increased volume and a more favorable sales mix.

Table of Contents 

 Segment operating income increased to 2.1 million, with operating margin of 2.6 percent, for the three-month period ended May 29, 2021, compared to an operating loss of 0.5 million and operating margin of (0.6) percent in the same period of the prior year. The improved profitability was driven by increased productivity in core glass operations, the more favorable sales mix, and higher volumes, which offset the impact of higher material and freight costs. 
 
 Architectural Services 
 Three Months Ended (In thousands) May 29, 2021 May 30, 2020 Change Net sales 75,656 63,551 19.0 Operating income 4,537 5,343 (15.1) Operating margin 6.0 8.4

 Operating margin decreased 240 basis points to 6.0 percent for the three-month period of the current year, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting isolated performance challenges on certain projects and a less favorable project mix. 
 As of May 29, 2021, segment backlog was approximately 559 million, compared to approximately 571 million as of the end of the prior quarter, and 685 million at the end of the first quarter of the prior year. Backlog is described within the Architectural Framing Systems discussion above.

 LSO net sales increased 17.9 million or 283.8 percent, for the three-month period ended May 29, 2021, compared to the same period in the prior year. In the prior year first quarter, the segment's customers and manufacturing operations were closed for a large part of the quarter to comply with COVID-related government directives. 
 
 The segment had operating income of 5.8 million and operating margin of 24.1 percent for the three-month period ended May 29, 2021, compared to operating loss of 3.1 million and operating margin of (49.6) percent in the same period of the prior year primarily driven by the increased sales volume.

In the first three months of the prior year, net cash used by investing activities was 9.7 million, driven by capital expenditures of 8.6 million. 
 
 Financing Activities. Net cash used by financing activities was 14.3 million for the first three months of fiscal 2022, compared to 17.3 million in the prior-year period, reflecting both borrowings and debt repayments in the prior year, and higher share repurchases in the current year first quarter. At May 29, 2021, we were in compliance with the financial covenants under our revolving credit facility and term loan. 
 
 We paid dividends totaling 5.0 million 0.2000 per share) in the first three months of fiscal 2022, compared to 4.9 million 0.1875 per share) in the comparable prior-year period. During the first three months of fiscal 2022, we repurchased 341,000 shares under our authorized share repurchase program, for a total cost of 12.2 million. In the first three months of fiscal 2021, we repurchased 231,492 shares under the share repurchase program, for a total cost of 4.7 million. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in 2004, we have purchased a total of 7,473,616 shares, at a total cost of 219.5 million. We currently have remaining authority to repurchase an additional 776,384 shares under this program. We will continue to evaluate making future share repurchases, considering our cash flow, debt levels and market conditions, in the context of all our capital allocation options ensuring that we maximize the long-term value for our shareholders. 
 
 Other Financing Activities. The following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity as of May 29, 2021: 
 Payments Due by Fiscal Period (In thousands) Remainder of Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2025 Fiscal 2026 Thereafter Total Debt obligations 2,000 1,000 150,000 12,000 165,000 Operating leases (undiscounted)

 182,836 74,288 12,342 160,891 9,016 25,174 464,547 
 
 We acquire the use of certain assets through operating leases, such as property, manufacturing equipment, vehicles and other equipment. Purchase obligations in the table above relate to raw material commitments and capital expenditures. 
 
 We expect to make contributions of 0.7 million to our defined-benefit pension plans in fiscal 2022, which will equal or exceed our minimum funding requirements. 
 
 As of May 29, 2021, we had reserves of 3.8 million for unrecognized tax benefits. We are unable to reasonably estimate in which future periods the remaining unrecognized tax benefits will ultimately be settled. 
 
 We are required, in the ordinary course of business, to provide surety or performance bonds that commit payments to our customers for any non-performance. At May 29, 2021, 1.2 billion of these types of bonds were outstanding, of which 527.3 million is in our backlog. These bonds do not have stated expiration dates. We have never been required to make payments under surety or performance bonds with respect to our existing businesses. 
 
 During calendar 2020, we took advantage of the option to defer remittance of the employer portion of Social Security tax as provided in the CARES Act. This deferral allowed us to retain cash during calendar year 2020 that would have otherwise been remitted to the federal government. At the end of fiscal 2021, we had deferred tax payments of 13.6 million, which are included within accrued payroll and other benefits and other non-current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The deferred tax payments will be repaid in two equal portions in calendar years 2021 and 2022. 
 
 Due to our ability to generate strong cash from operations and our borrowing capability under our committed revolving credit facility, we believe that our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund our working capital requirements, planned capital expenditures and dividend payments for at least the next 12 months. While we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to continue to fund our business for at least the next 12 months, the extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may impact our results of operations or liquidity is uncertain. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact our business will depend on future developments and public health advancements, which have been buoyed by vaccine production and distribution.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 The Company is a party to various legal proceedings incidental to its normal operating activities. In particular, like others in the construction supply and services industry, the Company is routinely involved in various disputes and claims arising out of construction projects, sometimes involving significant monetary damages or product replacement.

The Company is also subject to litigation arising out of areas such as employment practices, workers compensation and general liability matters.
