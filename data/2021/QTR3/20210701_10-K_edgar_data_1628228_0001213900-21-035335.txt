PART I 

Item 1. 
 Business 

OptiLeaf was incorporated under the laws of the
State of Florida on August 11, 2014. OptiLeaf, Inc. was formed to provide a world-class fully integrated turn-key growth management system
for the cannabis industry to help dispensary owners, grow operations and caregivers increase their sales and reduce costs, increase their
company s productivity and profitability and reduce or eliminate the need for manual labor while maximizing yield. OptiLeaf s
target market includes dispensaries and grow operations. 

Our Product 

OptiLeaf has completed the development of its
growth management GrowPro and point-of- sale POS software. These software offerings are the next generation
POS and growth management systems that provide a complete solution for cultivation operations, processing and manufacturing, and dispensaries
in the legal medical and recreational cannabis industry. Moreover, OptiLeaf has completed its Store Manager software and
it s currently in beta test. This back-end software allows store owners and managers to take command and streamline their business
in real-time. The main features are: Customized dashboard, sales trends, best-selling brands and products, top selling budtenders, sales
trend, analytic and detail mission critical reporting. 

Our POS software works with almost all POS hardware
and uses devices that dispensary owners already have. Our powerful custom reports enable dispensary owners and managers to make informed
decisions on how to increase profit and reduce operational costs while keeping them in compliant with the state. Our system prevents any
sale from exceeding state regulations, automatically verify the customers age and their purchase limits, print compliant labels
and receipts, and digitally file all patient records and reports. 

Our GrowPro growth management software allows
cultivators to track with real-time data of their plant history including genealogy, events, growth stages, watering and nutrient
cycles, yields, harvesting, and every aspect of the grow operations. 

Both products have complete integration with Metrc 
(state traceability system) for the State of Colorado, Oregon, and Michigan. This will allow growers and dispensary owners from having
to do double entry and manually reporting sales and cultivation data to the state. Sales and cultivation data are automatically downloaded
and synced accurately with state traceability systems. 

Marketing 

OptiLeaf focus its sales and marketing efforts
in the states of Colorado, Oregon and Washington at this point. We are planning on expanding our marketing into California and Michigan.
We have decided to focus our efforts with the most developed and broadest customer base at this point. 

OptiLeaf has opened a sales office in Denver,
CO. We believe that having a local presence will help accelerate sales and provide better customer service and support. In addition, having
a local market presence helps us gain a better understanding of the needs of our customers as well as challenges and opportunities in
the market. 

1 

Operations 

OptiLeaf s operational strategies behind
the development of our products and services are based on design, innovation, and added value. When developing a new product, we want
to be the leader by introducing innovative features that will allow cannabis cultivators to lower their costs, boost yields, and maximize
production capacity. Furthermore, when OptiLeaf develops new goods or services, we will package them with support services as well as
immediate observable and psychological benefits. Our focus is on how our products and services stand against the competition and how our
technical measures relate to the customers needs. 

Our primary operation strategy is to focus on
quality and service. Our products must meet our eight dimensions of quality: performance, conformance, features, durability, reliability,
serviceability, aesthetics, and perceived quality. Based on our operational strategies, we believe OptiLeaf s products and services
will be superior to the competition. We recognize that there are some limitations imposed by trade-offs that must be made due to the nature
of the product. For example, reliability may be sacrificed in order to achieve maximum speed. 

Fundraising 

OptiLeaf has continued the process of raising
additional capital, which will be used to build out a sales and marketing force, for further development of its products and technologies,
for hiring of additional personnel and for general working capital. The Company has not received any commitments for additional capital
at this point, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise the capital it seeks or can do so on terms satisfactory
to the Company. 

Staffing 

As of December 31, 2019, we have 3 full time employees.
The number of employees will be determined by the projected number of customers and that will need to be attended to. 

Suppliers 

OptiLeaf relies on overseas manufacturers to supply
various components of its product line. The most important benefit of using this type of supplier is that we are able to remain cost competitive
in our local market. We believe that this will give us a competitive advantage that can be used to increase the sales and profits of our
business. 

We plan on buying most of our inventory directly
from the manufacturer. Because we generally will be placing large orders, dealing directly with the manufacturer will yield the lowest
cost per unit. The down side of working with these large manufacturers is that we are not able to order in smaller quantities, resulting
in having a considerable sum of money tied up in each order. When a smaller quantity of product is necessary, we will use a smaller business-to-business
manufacturer. 

These manufacturers will require 30 days advance
notice for each order. Shipments from China typically take 7-10 days for delivery by air or 20-30 days by ocean freighter. 

Customer Service and Support 

Timely order fulfillment is crucial to customer
satisfaction. OptiLeaf will hire additional assistants as needed to monitor and manage the delivery, billing, warranty service and repair
of its products. This helps to ensure customer satisfaction and repeat sales. 

To improve operating efficiency, we plan to use
Amazon.com as our order fulfillment company. Their facilities are state-of-the-art and their customer satisfaction record
is unsurpassed. By outsourcing this function, we can keep internal staffing needs at a minimum and avoid having to expand our telephone
network and computer systems. We will also save on shipping costs due to the high-volume discounts Amazon.com earns by serving multiple
businesses from one location. 

Our customers emphasize that good service and
after-sales support are among their major concerns. A hot-line service is available to all registered customers enrolled in OptiLeaf s
maintenance / support program. 

Customer satisfaction will be a high priority
for OptiLeaf. Our main goal is to ensure that our products are made using the highest quality components so that there are few, if any,
returns due to product defects. Still, we recognize the fact that however good our product is, there will be times when it simply does
not meet the needs of some customers. To ensure a positive experience and image in the minds of these and all customers, we will offer
a money-back guarantee. Our objective is to make our customer service so satisfying that even if a customer decides to return a particular
product, we will retain that person as a loyal customer, who won t hesitate to refer friends and associates, and perhaps make other
purchases from OptiLeaf in the future.

Subcontractors 

In order to control our expenses, OptiLeaf is
currently subcontracting a portion of our advertising and marketing to third parties. This will potentially allow us to bring in professionals
with expertise that we have not yet acquired. 

Government Regulation 

OptiLeaf does not directly distribute, sell, grow,
harvest cannabis or any substances that violate United States law or the Controlled Substances Act, nor does it intend to do so in the
future. We are a technology provider to the cannabis industry. As such, we are operating within an industry that is very complex in terms
of legal requirements and compliance. Cannabis is an illegal drug under Federal Law and is illegal in many states as well. Certain states
have made cannabis legal for medicinal use only, but in very few circumstances is it legal to possess or sell cannabis. Although we plan
on being a technology provider only, and do not plan of growing, selling or possessing any cannabis, we nevertheless must comply with,
and our business must comply with, a myriad of state and local laws and regulations regarding our operations, and our operations, as well
as our profitability, can be significantly affected by all of these laws and how they affect the businesses or our customers. 

In addition, we are subject to a number of laws
and regulations that affect companies generally and specifically those conducting business on the internet, many of which are still evolving
and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth. These regulations
and laws may cover online marketing, e-mail marketing, telemarketing, taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights,
distribution, mobile communications, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, web services, the provision of
online payment services, unencumbered internet access to our services, the design and operation of websites, and the characteristics and
quality of products and services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, and personal privacy
apply to the internet, e-commerce, and digital content and web services. Unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for
our products and services and increase our cost of doing business. 

Litigation 

From time to time, we may become involved in various
lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise, in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties,
and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of
any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating
results. 

Item 1A.

Item 2. 
 Properties 

The Company has consolidated its operations and
has eliminated its two previous leases in favor of one lease, in a property owned by two related persons that was supposed to commence
on August 10, 2018, at a monthly cost of 2,000 plus the Company s pro rata share of operating expenses. The monthly rental and
operating cost payments have not been made and the parties agreed to rescind the lease effective January 1, 2019. The Company continues
to occupy the space on a month to month tenancy and will pay rent when economically feasible. 

Item 3. 
 Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we may become involved in various
lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise, in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties,
and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of
any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating
results.

Item 5. 
 Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

Market Information 

Our common stock has been approved for trading
on the Over the Counter (OTC) Markets under the symbol OPLF since March 15, 2016. The OTC Markets is a quotation service that displays
real-time quotes, last-sale prices, and volume information in over the counter, or the OTC, equity securities. 

Price range of common stock 

Our stock has not been quoted or traded as of
this filing. 

Holders 

As of December 31, 2019, we had 31 shareholders
of our common stock. 

Transfer Agent and Registrar 

ClearTrust, LLC is currently the transfer agent
and registrar for our common stock. Its address is 16540 Pointe Village Dr., Suite 206, Lutz, FL 33558. Its phone number is (813) 235-4490. 

Authorized Capital Stock 

Our authorized stock consists of 100,000,000 shares
of common stock, with no par value. There are currently 20,943,753 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, as of December 31, 2019. 

Common Stock 

Each share of our common stock entitles its holder
to one vote in the election of each director and on all other matters voted on generally by our stockholders, other than any matter that
(1) solely relates to the terms of any outstanding series of common stock or the number of shares of that series and (2) does not affect
the number of authorized shares of common stock or the powers, privileges and rights pertaining to the common stock. No share of our common
stock affords any cumulative voting rights. This means that the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares voting for the
election of directors can elect all directors to be elected if they choose to do so. 

4 

Holders of our common stock will be entitled to
dividends in such amounts and at such times as our Board of Directors in its discretion may declare out of funds legally available for
the payment of dividends. We currently intend to retain our entire available discretionary cash flow to finance the growth, development
and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future
dividends will be paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including: 

general business conditions; 

industry practice; 

our financial condition and performance; 

our future prospects; 

our cash needs and capital investment plans; 

our obligations to holders of any common stock we may issue; 

income tax consequences; and 

the restrictions Florida and other applicable laws and our credit arrangements then impose. 

If we liquidate or dissolve our business, the
holders of our common stock will share ratably in all our assets that are available for distribution to our stockholders after our creditors
are paid in full and the holders of all series of our outstanding common stock, if any, receive their liquidation preferences in full. 

Our common stock has no preemptive rights and
is not convertible or redeemable or entitled to the benefits of any sinking or repurchase fund. 

Dividends 

Since inception we have not paid any dividends
on our common stock. We currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock, when issued
pursuant to this offering. Although we intend to retain our earnings, if any, to finance the exploration and growth of our business, our
Board of Directors will have the discretion to declare and pay dividends in the future. Payment of dividends in the future will depend
upon our earnings, capital requirements, and other factors, which our Board of Directors may deem relevant. 

Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity
Compensation Plans 

We presently do not have any equity based or other
long-term incentive programs. In the future, we may adopt and establish an equity-based or other long-term incentive plan if it is in
the best interest of the Company and our shareholders to do so.

Item 6. 
 Selected Financial Data 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined

Item 7. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The information and financial data discussed
below is derived from our audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The audited financial statements
were prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The information and financial
data discussed below is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with the related notes contained elsewhere in this prospectus.
The financial statements contained elsewhere in this prospectus fully represent our financial condition and operations; however, they
are not indicative of our future performance. 

Overview 

We were incorporated under the laws of the State
of Florida on August 11, 2014. OptiLeaf, Inc. was formed to provide a world-class fully integrated turn-key growth management system for
the cannabis industry to help dispensary owners, grow operations and caregivers increase their sales and reduce costs, increase their
company s productivity and profitability and reduce or eliminate the need for manual labor while maximizing yield. OptiLeaf s
target market includes dispensaries and grow operations. 

Through December 31, 2019 our cumulative deficit
was 873,867 compared to a cumulative deficit as of December 31, 2018 of 856,438. On December 31, 2019 we had total current assets of
 32,129 and total current liabilities of 39,996 compared to total current assets of 13,590 and total current liabilities of 29,028
on December 31, 2018. 

Recent Developments 

OptiLeaf has completed the development of its
growth management GrowPro and point-of- sale POS software. These software are the next generation POS and
growth management systems that provide a complete solution for cultivation operations, processing and manufacturing, and dispensaries
in the legal medical and recreational cannabis industry. Moreover, OptiLeaf has completed its Store Manager software and
it s currently in beta test. This back-end software allows store owners and managers to take command and streamline their business

Both products have complete integration with Metrc 
(state traceability system) for the State of Colorado and Oregon. This will allow growers and dispensary owners from having to do double
entry and manually reporting sales and cultivation data to the state. Sales and cultivation data are automatically downloaded and synced
accurately with state traceability systems. 

Plan of Operation 

OptiLeaf plans to partner with popular online
live menu providers, CRM, and credit card payment systems to offer credit card and debit card acceptant and to provide real time online
inventory and pricing data. 

For the immediate succeeding years, the Company
plans to hire more staff and rely on organinc growth to continue to build brand awareness and increase sales. 

Results of Operations 

Because we continue to be developmental stage
and have been conducting development operations our revenue has been minimal. We generated revenue of 109,372 during the year ended December
31, 2019 compared to 47,697 during the year ended December 31, 2018. Cost of sales increased to 16,314 for the year ended December 31,
2019, compared to 10,810 for the year ended December 31, 2018. During those same periods, we had gross margins of 93,058 or 85.1 compared
to 36,887 or 90.6 of sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. During those same time periods operating expenses decreased to 114,517
from 192,468 resulting in a net loss for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 of 17,429 compared to a net loss of 156,679 for the
fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of December 31, 2019, we had cash of 20,495,
compared to 11,290 as of December 31, 2018. Our primary uses of cash were for employee compensation and working capital. The main sources
of cash were from our founders, investors, and from licensing of our software suite. The following trends are reasonably likely to result
in a material decrease in our liquidity over the near to long term: 

An increase in working capital requirements, 

Addition of administrative and sales personnel as the business grows, 

Increases in advertising, public relations and sales promotions as we commence operations, 

Research and Development, 

The cost of being a public company and the continued increase in costs due to governmental compliance activities. 

As the Company has experienced a decrease in its
available capital during each of the past 3 fiscal years, and we expect this trend to continue in the current year, the Company will likely
need to raise additional capital in the current fiscal year to continue to finance its business plans and activities. There can be no
assurance that the Company will be able to raise such capital, or on such terms as our acceptable to management. If the Company fails
to raise additional capital, the Company could be unable to execute on its business plans . 

Item 7A. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We are not required to provide the information
required by this Item because we are a smaller reporting company.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and 
Shareholders of Optileaf, Incorporated. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Optileaf, Incorporated. (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the related statement of operations, stockholders 
deficit and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to
as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended
December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Explanatory Paragraph- Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has
suffered recurring losses and for the year ended December 31, 2019 the Company had a net loss of 17,429 and accumulated losses since
inception of 873,867. The Company also had net cash used in operating activities of 15,796, and had negative working capital of 7,867.
These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters
are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Notes to Financial Statements 
For the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 

Note 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Organization 

OptiLeaf Incorporated OptiLeaf 
or the Company was incorporated in Florida in August 2014. The Company has been in the infancy stage since inception and
has generated minimal sales to date. The Company plans to develop, market and sell integrated software and hardware to the agriculture
industry for the seamless tracking and management of growth, task automation and sale of their clients products. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consisted of money market funds. At December
31, 2019, the Company had no cash equivalents. 

Accounts Receivable 

The Company has 7,590
and 2,300 of trade accounts receivable at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Company reviews the accounts receivable, at least quarterly,
and, if appropriate, records an allowance for doubtful accounts. No allowance was required as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Property and Equipment 

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation
is provided over the estimated useful lives (3 years) of the related assets using the straight-line depreciation method. 

Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations
when incurred. Betterments and improvements are capitalized. When property and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of, the asset
account and related accumulated depreciation account are reduced, and any gain or loss is included in operations. 

Capitalized Software Development Costs 

Software development costs are expensed as incurred
until technological feasibility of the product is established. Development costs incurred subsequent to technological feasibility will
be capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the product. Capitalization of computer software
costs will be discontinued when the computer software product is available to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed. Amortization will
begin when the product is available for release to customers. Management has determined as of December 31, 2019 that the software has
not yet reached the stage of technological feasibility. The Company has not maintained specific cost records, but estimates that 46,000
and 107,000 has been expensed for software development, and has been included in payroll costs, during the years ended December 31, 2019
and 2018 respectively.

For the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company adopted Accounting
Standards Update ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective January 1, 2018 using the
cumulative effect transition method. Two core principles of this new guidance, which was codified into Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, are that an entity should (a) measure revenue in connection
with its sale of goods and services to a customer based on the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for
each of those goods and services and (b) recognize revenue upon satisfaction of its performance obligations under the contract. An entity s
performance obligation is considered satisfied when (or as) control of the promised goods and services are transferred to the customer. 

In general, the Company will record revenue when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or product delivery has occurred, the sales price to the customer
is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. The following policies reflect specific criteria for the various revenues
streams of the Company: 

Revenue will be recognized at the time the product
is delivered or services are performed. Provision for sales returns will be estimated based on the Company s historical return experience.
Revenue will be presented net of returns. 

Research and
Development 

The cost of research and development is charged to expense when incurred. 

Net Loss per Common Share 

Basic net (loss) income per common share is calculated
using the weighted average common shares outstanding during each reporting period. Diluted net (loss) income per common share adjusts
the weighted average common shares for the potential dilution that could occur if common stock equivalents (convertible debt and preferred
stock, warrants, stock options and restricted stock shares and units) were exercised or converted into common stock. There were no common
stock equivalents at December 31, 2019 and 2018. 

Income Taxes 

Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax
consequences related to temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
the amounts used for tax purposes at each year end, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which
the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized when, based on the weight of all available
evidence, it is considered more likely than not that all, or some portion, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Income tax
expense is the sum of current income tax plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. 

ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires a company to first
determine whether it is more likely than not (which is defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be
sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have
full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized
at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. 

The Federal and state income tax returns of the
Company for 2019, 2018, and 2017 are subject to examination by the internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities for three (3)
years from the date filed. 

Equity instruments granted to non-employees are
accounted for in accordance with ASC 505, Equity. The final measurement date for the fair value of equity instruments with performance
criteria is the date that each performance commitment for such equity instrument is satisfied or there is a significant disincentive for
non-performance. 

F- 8 

OptiLeaf, Inc. 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 

Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company accounts for equity instruments issued
to employees in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. ASC 718 requires all share-based compensation payments to
be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value using an option pricing model. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated
at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates. 

Equity instruments granted to non-employees are
accounted for in accordance with ASC 505, Equity. The final measurement date for the fair value of equity instruments with performance
criteria is the date that each performance commitment for such equity instrument is satisfied or there is a significant disincentive for
non-performance. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

Pursuant to ASC No. 820, Fair Value Measurement
and Disclosures , the Company is required to estimate the fair value of all financial instruments included on its balance sheet
as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The Company s financial instruments consist of accounts payable and accrued expenses.
The Company considers the carrying value of such amounts in the financial statements to approximate their fair value due to the short-term
nature of these financial instruments. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to recognize most lease liabilities on their balance sheets but recognize the
expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current practice. The update states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability
for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The update
is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The impact of this guidance
will result in the recognition of assets and liabilities for leases that the Company enters into in the future. 

Other recent accounting pronouncements issued
by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and
Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s present or future financial
statements.

Note 2. GOING CONCERN 

The Company s financial statements are presented
on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

The
Company has experienced a loss from operations during its development stage as a result of its investment necessary to achieve its operating
plan, which is long-range in nature . During
the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company incurred a net loss of 17,429 and at December 31, 2019 has accumulated losses, since inception
of 873,867. In addition, the Company has minimal revenue generating operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty . 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is in doubt and dependent upon achieving a profitable level of operations or on
the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to fund ongoing operations. Management believes that its current and future plans
enable it to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. 

To
meet these objectives, the Company continues to seek other sources of financing in order to support existing operations and expand the
range and scope of its business. However, there are no assurances that any such financing can be obtained on acceptable terms and timely
manner, if at all. The failure to obtain the necessary working capital would have a material adverse effect on the business prospects
and, depending upon the shortfall, the Company may have to curtail or cease its operations. 

The Company has experienced losses, from operations,
during its development stage, as a result of the investment necessary to achieve its operating plan, which is long-range in nature. For
the period from inception through December 31, 2019, the Company incurred accumulated losses of 873,867 compared to a cumulative loss
through December 31, 2018, of 856,438. For the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as the result of increased revenue and decreased
intellectual property cost of 61,675 and 66,368 respectively, the Company reduced its net loss to 17,429 compared to 156,679 and had
negative working capital of 7,867 compared to 15,438 for the year ended December 31, 2018. These conditions raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to
the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this
uncertainty. 

During the year ended December 31, 2019 the Company
used 24,545 for operating expenses compared to 140,907 during the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company generated 25,000 from the
sale of common stock, and 8,750 from a related party loan compared to 50,000 from the sale of common stock, 40,000 from the sale of
notes payable and 45,000 from related parties, during the year ended December 31, 2018. 

The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern is in doubt and dependent upon achieving a profitable level of operations or on the ability of the Company to obtain necessary
financing to fund ongoing operations. Management believes that its current and future plans enable it to continue as a going concern for
the next twelve months.

To meet these objectives, the Company continues
to seek other sources of financing in order to support existing operations and expand the range and scope of its business. However, there
are no assurances that any such financing can be obtained on acceptable terms and timely manner, if at all. The failure to obtain the
necessary working capital would have a material adverse effect on the business prospects and, depending upon the shortfall, the Company
may have to curtail or cease its operations. 

The accompanying financial statements do not include
any adjustment to the recorded assets or liabilities that might be necessary should the Company have to curtail operations or be unable
to continue in existence. 

Note 3. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

During the year ended December 31, 2018, two Company
officers loaned the Company 45,000, unsecured, maturing on April 1, 2020, bearing interest of 3 . On December 31, 2019, the Company repaid
 40,000 of the outstanding debt by issuing 1,000,000 common shares, previously designated as treasury stock, to the two individuals. 

Note 4. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY 

Common stock 

The Company has authorized 100,000,000 shares
of no par value common stock. At December 31, 2019, the number of shares of common stock issued was 20,943,753. 

On July 25, 2018, the Company issued, for cash,
to two investors, 333,334 restricted common shares for a total of 50,000, recorded at a cost of 0.15 per share. 

On March 4, 2019 the Company issued, for cash,
to one investor, 166,667 restricted common shares for 25,000, recorded at a cost of 0.15 per share. 

Treasury stock 

On September 20, 2016, the Board of Directors
authorized the Company to repurchase one million shares of common stock for 40,000. These treasury stock shares may, at any time, be
canceled upon the Board of Directors approval. The Board has not made such election. On December 31, 2019 the 1,000,000 treasury shares
were issued to two related parties to repay 40,000 of a loan that they had made to the Company. 

Note 5. CONCENTRATION CREDIT RISK 

At December 31, 2019 the Company had two non 
related customers that owed 26 and 20 of total accounts receivable and three unrelated customers that owed 12 each of total accounts
receivable. At December 31, 2018 the Company had two non related customers that owed 58.5 and 41.5 of total accounts receivable. 

The Company maintains its cash balances in a local
financial institution which at times may exceed the 250,000 amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). On December
31, 2019 and 2018 the Company did not have any cash balances which exceeded the limeit.

Note 6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

On August 10, 2018 the Company leased its offices
for six years, payable at the rate of 2,000 per month, plus the Company s pro rata share of operating expenses. No payments were
made and the lease was terminated without any liability effective January 1, 2019. The Company has continued to occupy the space, on a
month to month, tenancy, with the understanding that some or all of the unpaid portion will be paid as economics permits. 

Note 7. INCOME TAXES 

The Company accounts
for income taxes under the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC No. 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 ). Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 

The new tax bill reduced
the federal income tax rate for corporations from 35 to 21 . 

At December 31, 2019, the Company has a net operating
loss carryforward of approximately 861,010 for Federal and State purposes. This loss will be available to offset future taxable income.
If not used, this carryforward will begin to expire in 2035. The deferred tax asset relating to the operating loss carryforward has been
fully reserved at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The change in the valuation allowance was approximately 0 and 54,424 for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The principal difference between the operating loss for income tax purposes and reporting purposes
is disallowed meals and entertainment and a temporary difference in depreciation expense. 

Utilization of the Company s net operating
losses may be subject to substantial annual limitation if the Company experiences a 50 change in ownership, as provided by the Internal
Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an ownership change would substantially increase the possibility of net operating losses
expiring before complete utilization.

Item 9A. 
 Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company s
management, including the Company s President, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and Director, of the effectiveness
of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the
period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the
Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including
the Company s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure for the reasons discussed below. 

The management of the Company is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Our internal control system was designed
to, in general, provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and board regarding the preparation and fair presentation
of published financial statements, but because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of the
Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. The framework used by management in making that assessment
was the criteria set forth in the document entitled Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, our President and Chief Financial Officer have determined and concluded
that, as of December 31, 2019, the Company s internal control over financial reporting were not effective. 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control our financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, the Company determined that the following items
constituted a material weakness: 

The Company does not have an independent audit committee in place, which would provide oversight of the Company s officers, operations and financial reporting function; 

The Company s accounting department, which consists of a limited number of personnel, does not provide adequate segregation of duties and timely information; and 

The Company does not have effective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. 

Management believes that the appointment of one
or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy the lack of a functioning audit
committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board. Management plans to take action and implementing improvements to
our controls and procedures when our financial position permits. 

This annual report does not include an attestation
report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s
report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to the permanent exemption of
the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

No change in our system of internal control over
financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this report (i.e. the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019)
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
