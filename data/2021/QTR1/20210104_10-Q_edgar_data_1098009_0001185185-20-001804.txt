AMERICA GREAT HEALTH AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 FORMERLY CROWN MARKETING AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

NOTE 1 BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of America Great Health, formerly Crown Marketing and Subsidiaries (the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending June 30, 2019. 

Nature of the Business 

Through December 31, 2016, the Company s primary business activity was the sale of various consumer products and accessories. A change of control of the Company was completed on January 19, 2017 from Jay Hooper, the former officer and director of the Company and its former majority shareholder. Control was obtained by the sale of 16,155,746,000 shares of Company common stock from Mr. Hooper to an investor group led by Mike Q. Wang. In connection with the change of control, the Company sold to its former majority shareholder one of its subsidiary for 100 and another subsidiary in exchange for the cancellation of all payables and accrued expenses. After December 31, 2016, the Company s operations are determined and structured by the new investor group. As such, the Company accounted for all of its assets, liabilities and results of operations up to January 1, 2017 as discontinued operations. 

On March 1, 2017, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Wyoming an Articles of Amendment to change the corporate name from Crown Marketing to America Great Health. 

On March 9, 2017, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, America Great Health, under the laws of the State of California. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring net losses. For the nine months ended March 31, 2019, the Company recorded a net loss of 51,705, used cash to fund operating activities of 26,763, and at March 31, 2019, had a shareholders deficit of 159,158. These factors create substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within the next twelve months from the date these financial statements are available to be issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

During the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company s former majority shareholder sold his shares to an investor group. The new owners plans to continue as a going concern revolve around its ability to achieve profitable operations, as well as raise necessary capital to pay ongoing general and administrative expenses of the Company. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on securing additional sources of capital and the success of the Company s plan. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising the additional capital or in achieving profitable operations. 

Our cash needs for the months ended March 31, 2019 were primarily met by loans and advances from current majority shareholder. As of March 31, 2019, we had a cash balance of 198. We intend to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and advance from current majority shareholder. 

NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis of Consolidation 

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its current wholly owned subsidiary, America Great Health in California. Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.

Table of Contents 

Reclassifications 

Prior period numbers have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Professional fee was reclassified to be separately disclosed on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended March 31, 2019. 

Estimates 

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include accounting for potential liabilities and the assumptions made in valuing stock instruments issued for services. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value measurements are determined using authoritative guidance issued by the FASB, with the exception of the application of the guidance to non-recurring, non-financial assets and liabilities as permitted. Fair value is defined in the authoritative guidance as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy was established, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows: 

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

 Level 2 Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, are observable either directly or indirectly. 

 Level 3 Unobservable inputs based on the Company s assumptions. 

The Company is required to use observable market data if available without undue cost and effort. 

The Company s financial instruments include cash and accounts payable. Management has estimated that the carrying amounts approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature. 

Loss per Share 

Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares available. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. The Company s diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, as there are no potential shares outstanding that would have a dilutive effect. 

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. The Company recorded a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2018 and 2017. 

The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company classifies the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that the Company anticipates payment (or receipt) of cash within one year. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the provision for income taxes.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In July 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features, (Part II) , which is the replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests with a Scope Exception. The amendments in Part I of this Update that relate to the recognition, measurement, and earnings per share of certain freestanding equity-classified financial instruments that include down round features affect entities that present earnings per share in accordance with the guidance in Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. The amendments in Part II of this Update do not have an accounting effect. The amendments in Part I of the update are effective for fiscal year, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is assessing the impact to its accounting practices and financial reporting procedures as a result of the issuance of this standard. 

Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or is not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s present or future consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE 3 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

During the nine months ended March 31, 2019, the Company's current majority shareholder advanced 28,446 to the Company as working capital. As of March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018, the Company owed its current majority shareholder of 127,470 and 100,525 respectively. The advances are non-interest bearing and are due on demand.

NOTE 4 CONVERTIBLE, REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK 

During the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the creation of a series of preferred stock consisting of 1,000,000 shares designated as Series A Preferred Stock (the Series A ). The Series A is entitled to a dividend of 4 , when and as declared, and is entitled to a liquidation preference of 1 per share plus unpaid dividends. The Series A is redeemable at the option of the Company at any time, in whole or in part, at a price of 1.00 per share, plus 4 per annum thereupon from the date of issuance (the Stated Value ). In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the Series A shall be entitled to a preferential amount equal to the Stated Value, prior to the holders of common stock receiving any distribution. Each share of Series A is automatically converted on the Conversion Date into a number of shares of common stock of the Company at the initial conversion rate (the Conversion Rate ), which shall be the Stated Value as of the date of conversion divided by the Market Price. The Market Price for purposes of this Section 5 shall be equal to the average closing sales price of the Common Stock over the 5 previous trading days. 

The Series A is also subject to adjustments to the Conversion Rate. If the common stock issuable on conversion of the Series A is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for above), the holders of the Series A shall, upon its conversion, be entitled to receive, in lieu of the common stock which the holders would have become entitled to receive but for such change, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders if they had exercised their rights of conversion of the Series A immediately before that change. 

In August 2016, the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Series A Preferred Stock from 1,000,000 to 10,000,000. 

There were no preferred shares outstanding as of March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018.

History and Organization 

America Great Health, formerly Crown Marketing, is a Wyoming corporation (the Company ). Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated December 2, 2013, the Company acquired all of the common stock of Okra Energy, Inc., a California corporation that was subscribed for on December 2, 2013 and then incorporated on December 18, 2013, in exchange for 16,155,746,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company (the Common Stock at the closing of the Agreement on December 3, 2013.

A change of control took place on January 19, 2017 from Jay Hooper.

On March 9, 2017, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, America Great Health, under the laws of the State of California. 

Overview of Business 

The Company under the new management will focus its business in the health related industry.

3. 

Sales Agreement between Mike Wang and Dr. William Fang for the marketing and sales of Dr. Fang s early detection system of Cardio Vascular diseases. The device provides unique 3D imaging for the Cardio Vascular conditions for patients and has already won approval of US FDA. It has very positive significance in helping preventing heart attacks, which are the number one killer in the US as well as in the world. 

On March 5, 2018, America Great Health, a California Corporation AAGH CA ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Sino-foreign Co-operative Joint Venture Contract (the JV Agreement with Guangzhou Bona Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Bona to establish a JV,Pomeikang Biotechnology (Guangzhou) Co., Ltd. Pomeikang ), to promote and develop sales channels for health and cosmetics related products supplied by AAGH CA in the mainland of the People s Republic of China, the Hong Kong Special Administration Region and the Macau Special Administration Region (together, the China Market ). 

Pursuant to the JV Agreement, AAGH CA and Bona each own 49 and 51 of Pomeikang, respectively, and AAGH California has the veto right to stop the majority shareholder s decision. AAGH CA will contribute the initial products supply in equivalent of cash amount of RMB 2.45 million 368,000) to Pomeikang and Bona will contribute any required operating capital, experienced sales team, promotional effort, and customer services to ensure normal day to day operation of Pomeikang. Bona will also be responsible for acquiring any required government permits, sales permits, and business licenses for Pomeikang. 

At December 31, 2018, the Company decided to no longer participate in Pomeikang s operations. On April 1, 2019, AAGH California transferred its 49 ownership to Bona for 1. 

On May 21, 2018, the Company, entered into an Exclusive Oversea Distribution Agreement (the Agreement with Foshan Wanshunbao Technology Co., Ltd. Wanshunbao ), a mainland China based company. According to the Agreement, Wanshunbao wishes to promote and develop overseas sales channels for its unique Mysteries Fruit tea and related products worldwide. The Company is appointed as Wanshunbao s exclusive distributor to market and sell the Mysteries Fruit herbal tea and related products in geographic areas covers all over the world except mainland China. 

In the past 20 years, Wangshunbao has dedicated to improve its R D, and production of the unique Mysteries Fruit and related supplemental products, currently, Wangshunbao has developed a leading role in this industry, and is in the process of expanding its business model worldwide to a 10 billion RMB 1.5 billion) industry chain. To achieve that goal, Wangshunbao s management team had been actively seeking a qualified international distributor and business partner to execute its expansion plan. 

The Company s management team was invited to Foshan, China in early May, 2018 to visit Wangshunbao and its production facilities, upon extensive discussion and negotiation, the Company was granted with exclusive distribution rights worldwide for Mysteries Fruit tea and related products. The Company believes by introducing Mysteries Fruit products to oversee consumers would have a huge beneficial effect; and the management is confident about this business opportunity, as the Company s core team members all have been in health and supplemental related industry for over 20 years, and has substantial nutrient products sales experiences and marketing channels. The Company is currently conducting preliminary sales campaigns for Mysteries Fruit products. 

The Company is also planning to conduct additional acquisitions. Mike Wang has approached several health related companies in China and met the management of potential acquisition targets. Rapid economic advances in China in the last thirty years have greatly improved the living standards in China. This in turn brings demand in healthcare products and services. The Company feels strongly that despite the challenges of cross border business, it might be able to acquire some good growth companies and bring good values to our stockholders. 

As inherent with any new business development, there are risks involved in such endeavor. For all the healthcare related businesses afore-mentioned, the Company is evaluating what kind of risks we are facing. The Company notices that vitamin and nutrition supplement business is a highly competitive market and faces multiple regulatory monitoring. The compliance challenge is constant. Regarding proton treatment sales, the device is very expensive and for such large ticket item, the procurement process can be long and arduous. The sale of cardio vascular device also has its challenges. The device is not well known and the acceptance of the use requires major efforts in educating not only the medical professionals but also consumers. This would demand financial as well as other resources. Although the Company is making some progress in the Merger and Acquisition efforts, any potential results, if any, are still not certain.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Estimates 

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The more significant estimates and assumptions by management include among others, the fair value of shares of common stock issued for services. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

See Footnote 2 of the financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards. 

Results of Operations 

Results of Operations for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018 . 

There was no revenue and cost of sales for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2019. 

Operating expenses incurred for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018 was 37,927 and 37,078, respectively. Operating expenses incurred for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was 7,531 and 9,099, respectively. The decrease in the quarter ended March 31, 2019 was mainly due to the lower professional fee. 

Our net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018 was 7,531 and 9,099, respectively. Our net loss for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018 was 51,705 and 37,878, respectively. The decrease in net loss in the quarter ended March 31, 2019 was mainly due to the lower professional fee. The increase in net loss in the nine months ended March 31, 2019 was mainly due to the loss on disposal of JV investment, partly offset by lower professional fee. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures. 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring net losses. For the nine months ended March 31, 2019, the Company recorded a net loss of 51,705, used cash to fund operating activities of 26,763, and at March 31, 2019, had a shareholders deficit of 159,158. For the nine months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded a net loss of 37,878, used cash to fund operating activities of 30,597. These factors create substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

The new management s plans to continue as a going concern revolve around its ability to achieve profitable operations, as well as raise necessary capital to pay ongoing general and administrative expenses of the Company. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on securing additional sources of capital and the success of the Company s plan. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising the additional capital or in achieving profitable operations. 

Our cash needs for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 were primarily met by loans and advances from current majority shareholder. As of March 31, 2019, we had a cash balance of 198. Our new majority shareholders will need to provide all of our working capitals going forward. 

Primarily as a result of our recurring losses and our lack of liquidity, we received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm for our financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2018 that includes an explanatory paragraph describing the uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
