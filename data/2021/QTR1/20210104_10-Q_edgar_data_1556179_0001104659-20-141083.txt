CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS 

The statements contained in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may include
our statements regarding our goals, beliefs, strategies, objectives, plan, including product and service developments, future financial
conditions, results or projections or current expectations. Such forward-looking statements may be identified by, among other things,
the use of forward-looking terminology such as believes, estimates, intends, plan 
 expects, may, will, should, predicts, anticipates, continues, 
or potential, or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, and similar expressions
are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We remind readers that forward-looking statements are merely predictions and
therefore inherently subject to uncertainties and other factors and involve known and unknown risks that could cause the actual
results, performance, levels of activity, or our achievements, or industry results, to be materially different from any future
results, performance, levels of activity, achievements, or industry results, expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
Such uncertainties and risks include those discussed in the Risk Factors and similar sections of our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2019 and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which
are incorporated by reference herein. Forward-looking statements appear in Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 

Our management has included projections
and estimates in this Form 10-Q, which are based primarily on management s experience in the industry, assessments of our
results of operations, discussions and negotiations with third parties and a review of information filed by our competitors with
the SEC or otherwise publicly available. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of the date made. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking
statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or
unanticipated events except as otherwise required by law. 

Unless otherwise specified or required by context, as used in
this Report, the terms we, our, us and the Company refer collectively to RMR Industrials,
Inc. RMR and its wholly/majority-owned subsidiaries, RMR Aggregates, Inc., RMR Logistics, Inc., Rail Land Company,
LLC, RMR Recycling, Inc., RMR Water, LLC and RMR Ready Mix, Inc.. Unless otherwise indicated, the term common stock 
refers to shares of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. 

Our financial statements are stated in
United States Dollars (US and are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP).

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING EXPLORATION
STAGE STATUS 

 AND USE OF CERTAIN MINING TERMS 

We are considered an exploration
stage company under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Industry Guide 7, Description of Property
by Issuers Engaged or to be Engaged in Significant Mining Operations Guide 7 ), because we do not have reserves as
defined under Guide 7. Reserves are defined in Guide 7 as that part of a mineral deposit which can be economically and
legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The establishment of reserves under Guide 7
requires, among other things, certain spacing of exploratory drill holes to establish the required continuity of mineralization
and the completion of a detailed cost or feasibility study. Since we have no reserves as defined in Guide 7, we have
not exited the exploration stage and continue to report our financial information as an exploration stage entity as required under
relevant accounting principles. We will remain an exploration stage company under Guide 7 until such time as we demonstrate
reserves in accordance with the criteria in Guide 7. 

Since we have no reserves, we will expense
all mine construction costs, even though these expenditures are expected to have a future economic benefit in excess of one year. We
will also expense our reclamation and remediation costs at the time the obligation is incurred. Companies that have
reserves and have exited the exploration stage typically capitalize these costs, and subsequently amortize them on a units-of-production
basis as reserves are mined, with the resulting depletion charge allocated to inventory, and then to cost of sales as the inventory
is sold. As a result of these and other differences, our financial statements will not be comparable to the financial
statements of mining companies that have established reserves and have exited the exploration stage. 

We use certain terms in this report such
as production, mining or processing activities, and mine construction. Production
means the estimated quantities (tonnage) delivered or shipped to our customers, which may result in disclosure of related limestone
and dolomite sales. Mining or processing activities means the process of extracting limestone and dolomite from the
earth and treating that material. Mine construction means work carried out to access areas in the mine containing limestone
and dolomite, which principally includes road construction, ramp construction and ancillary activities. We use these terms
in this report since we believe they are necessary and helpful for the reader to understand our business and operations. 
However, we caution you that we do not have reserves and therefore have not exited the exploration stage as defined in Guide 7,
and our use of the terminology described above is not intended to indicate that we have established reserves or have exited the
exploration stage for purposes of Guide 7. Furthermore, since we do not have reserves, we cannot provide any indication or
assurance as to how long we will likely continue mining activities at our mine site or whether such activities will be profitable.

RMR Industrials, Inc. (the
 Company , RMR , we , our , us .) seeks to acquire and consolidate
complementary industrial assets. RMI s consolidation strategy is to assemble a portfolio of mature and value-add
industrial commodities businesses to generate scalable enterprises with a broad portfolio of products and services addressing
a common and stable customer base. 

On February 27, 2015 (the Closing
Date ), the Company entered into and consummated a merger transaction pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger
Agreement by and among the Company, OLYB Acquisition Corporation, a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company Merger Sub and RMR IP, Inc., a Nevada corporation RMR IP ). In accordance with the terms
of Merger Agreement, on the Closing Date, Merger Sub merged with and into RMR IP (the Merger ), with RMR IP surviving
the Merger as our wholly owned subsidiary. 

RMR IP was formed to acquire and consolidate
complementary industrial commodity assets through capitalizing on the volatile oil markets, down cycles in commodity markets, and
other ancillary opportunities. RMR IP is focused on managing the supply chain in order to offer a large and diverse set of products
and services. 

For financial reporting purposes, the Merger
represented a reverse merger rather than a business combination and RMR IP was deemed to be the accounting acquirer
in the transaction. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations reflected in the Company s financial
statements post-Merger are those of RMR IP. The Company s assets, liabilities and results of operations have been consolidated
with the assets, liabilities and results of operations of RMR IP after consummation of the Merger, and the historical financial
statements of the Company before the Merger were replaced with the historical financial statements of RMR IP before the Merger
in all post-Merger filings with the SEC. 

On July 28, 2016, we formed RMR Aggregates,
Inc., a Colorado corporation RMR Aggregates ), as our wholly owned subsidiary. RMR Aggregates was formed to hold
assets whose primary focus is the mining and processing of industrial minerals for the manufacturing, construction and agriculture
sectors. These minerals include limestone, aggregates, marble, silica, barite and sand. 

On October 12, 2016, RMR Aggregates acquired
substantially all of the assets from CalX Minerals, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company CalX through an Asset
Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, RMR Aggregates agreed to purchase, and CalX agreed to
sell, substantially all of the assets associated with the Mid-Continent Quarry on 41 BLM unpatented placer mining claims in Garfield
County, Colorado, including the mining claims, improvements, access rights, water rights, equipment, inventory, contracts, permits,
certain intellectual property rights, and other tangible and intangible assets associated with the limestone mining operation. 

On January 3, 2017, we amended the Articles
of Incorporation of RMR IP, Inc. to rename the corporation to RMR Logistics, Inc. RMR Logistics ). RMR Logistics
operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company to provide transportation and logistics services. 

During January 2018, the Company formed
Rail Land Company, LLC Rail Land Company as a wholly-owned subsidiary to acquire and develop a rail terminal and
services facility (the Rail Park ). Rail Land Company purchased an approximately 470-acre parcel of real property
located in Bennett, Colorado on February 1, 2018. During July 2018, we exercised our option to acquire an additional approximately
150 acres for a total of 620 acres. 

F- 5 

On April 26, 2019, RMR Logistics
entered into an asset purchase agreement with H2K, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company the Seller pursuant to which RMR Logistics acquired the Seller s trucking assets. 

On January 1, 2020, the Company changed
its name from RMR Industrials, Inc. to Rocky Mountain Industrials, Inc., (RMI). 

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements for the period ended June 30, 2019 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States for interim financial information in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations. 

Business
Acquisitions 

When
the Company acquires businesses where substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single
identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets it is not considered a business. As such, the Company accounts for these
types of acquisitions as asset acquisitions. When substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is not concentrated
in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar assets and contains acquired inputs and processes which have the ability to
contribute to the creation of outputs, these acquisitions are accounted for as business combinations. 

The
Company considers single identifiable assets as tangible assets that are attached to and cannot be physically removed and used
separately from another tangible asset without incurring significant cost or significant diminution in utility or fair value. The
Company considers similar assets as assets that have a similar nature and risk characteristics. 

Whether
the Company s acquisitions are treated as an asset acquisition under ASC 360 or a business combination under ASC 805, the
fair value of the purchase price is allocated among the assets acquired and any liabilities assumed by valuing the property as
if it was vacant. The as-if-vacant value is allocated to land, buildings, improvements and any liabilities,
based on management s determination of the relative fair values of such assets and liabilities as of the date of acquisition. 

Upon
acquisition, the Company allocates the purchase price based upon the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired. The
Company allocates the purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets. The Company values improvements at replacement
cost, adjusted for depreciation. 

Management s
estimates of value are made using a comparable sales analysis of similar businesses. Factors considered by management in its analysis
of include equipment types and the sales prices of comparable assets. The Company includes an estimate of property taxes in
the purchase price allocation of acquisitions to account for the expected liability that was assumed. 

When
above or below market leases are acquired, the Company values the intangible assets based on the present value of the difference
between prevailing market rates and the in-place rates measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above
market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases that are
considered bargain renewal options. The above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining
term of the respective leases. The fair value of acquired below market leases, included in deferred revenue on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets, is amortized as an increase to rental income on a straight-line basis over the remaining non-cancelable
terms of the respective leases, plus the terms of any below market fixed rate renewal options that are considered bargain renewal
options of the respective leases. 

The
Company capitalizes acquisition costs and due diligence costs if the asset is expected to qualify as an asset acquisition. If the
asset acquisition is abandoned, the capitalized asset acquisition costs are expensed to acquisition and due diligence costs in
the period of abandonment. Costs associated with a business combination are expensed to acquisition and due diligence costs as
incurred. 

In
the event of a business combination, using information available at the time of business combination, the Company allocates the
total consideration to tangible assets and liabilities and identified intangible assets and liabilities. During the
measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may adjust the preliminary purchase price
allocations after obtaining more information about assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition.

NOTE B SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES 

A summary of significant accounting policies
of the Company is presented to assist in understanding the Company s consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies
presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ). The audited
consolidated financial statements include the financial condition and results of operations of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, where
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Management considers many factors in selecting appropriate financial
accounting policies and controls, and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial
statements. Management must apply significant judgment in this process. In addition, other factors may affect estimates, including:
expected business and operational changes, sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates,
and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends. The estimation process may yield a range of potentially
reasonable estimates of the ultimate future outcomes and management must select an amount that falls within that range of reasonable
estimates. Although these estimates are based on the Company s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in
the future, actual results may ultimately materially differ from those estimated amounts and assumptions used in the preparation
of the financial statements. 

Revenue Recognition 

As of January 1,2018, we adopted ASU NO.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The Company recognizes
revenues, upon delivery of goods to the customer at which time the Company s performance obligation is satisfied
 at an amount that the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods in accordance with the five step analysis
outlined in Topic 606: (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract,
(iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognize revenue
when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied. 

Revenue includes product sales of
limestone, aggregate materials and other transportation charges to customers, net of discounts, allowances or taxes, as applicable. 

Segment Reporting 

Operating segments are
identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by
the chief operating decision-maker in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. As of June
30, 2019, the Company views its operations and manages its business as three operating segments, Aggregates mining, Logistics
and Rail Park. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The Company considers all highly liquid
securities with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. As of June 30, 2019,
the Company had cash of 855,977 and no cash equivalents. The Company may occasionally maintain cash balances in excess of amounts insured
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ). The amounts are held with major financial institutions and
are monitored by management to mitigate credit risk. 

F- 7 

Restricted Cash 

The Company has 112,130 in
restricted cash held as cash collateral for a reclamation bond for the Bureau of Land Management and Colorado Division of
Reclamation, Mining and Safety, to be held for the rehabilitation costs of the Mid-Continent Quarry and conclusion of the
mining at this location. 

Accounts Receivable 

Accounts receivables are recorded at the
invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company analyzes collectability based on historical payment patterns and macroeconomic
factors which may affect the customers industry. Past due balances over 90 days based on payment terms are reviewed individually
for collectability. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. Concentration of
credit risk is limited to certain customers to whom we make substantial sales. As of June 30, 2019, the Company had one large customer
that accounted for approximately 34 of our accounts receivable balance and 69 of our revenue. To reduce risk, we routinely assess
the financial strength of our most significant customers, using standard credit risk evaluation methods with reference to publicly
available and customer supplied information, and monitor the amounts owed and take appropriate action when necessary. As a result,
we believe that accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited. 

Inventory 

Inventories are valued at the lower of
cost or market. Cost is determined by the weighted average method. 

Property, Plant and Equipment 

Property, plant and equipment are recorded
at cost. Significant improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repair expenses are charged to operations as incurred.
The straight-line method of depreciation is used for substantially all of the assets for financial reporting purposes. 

Depletion of acquired mineral properties
is determined pursuant to a unit-of-extraction method which provides for depletion of such costs over the productive life of the
mineral properties. The unit-of-extraction rate is determined by computing the production for the period as a percentage of total
estimated and recoverable limestone as of that period. Significant judgement is involved in the determination of the estimate of
total recoverable limestone in the unit-of-extraction method. Our internal engineering estimates of total estimated and recoverable
limestone is a key component in determination of the unit-of-extraction rate. Our estimates of the recoverable limestone may change,
possibly in the near term, resulting in changes to depletion rates in future periods. During the years ended June 30, 2019 and
2018, depletion of mineral properties was approximately 7,992 and 10,618 

We are considered an exploration
stage company under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Industry Guide 7 as such the Company
expenses any development costs as incurred. 

Land Under Development 

Land under development is recorded at cost.
Significant improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repair expenses are charged to operations as incurred. These costs
relate to the ongoing development of the Rail Park. 

Lease Obligations 

On April 1, 2019, we adopted FASB ASU 2016-02, Leases: (Topic 842) ASU 2016-02 ), which sets out the principles for the
recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and
lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or
operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the
lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest
method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a
right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their
classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for
operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially
equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. 

For leases in which the Company is
the lessee, the Company determined that the guidance has a material impact as the Company has three operating leases for
office space. Two of these leases have greater than 12 months remaining on the term of these leases at the date of the
adoption of this guidance and as such the Company recorded a right of use asset and a lease liability of 491,111 at the date
of adoption. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases.
The Company also is committed to a lease for a portable office space and for the use of a Dozer within the Company s
aggregates operation, on adoption of the new lease accounting standard the Company recorded a right of use asset and lease
liability of 35,625 for these leases. 

F- 8 

Equipment Loan 

The Company has bought certain specialized
mining and trucking equipment under finance terms. The financed equipment is recorded at cost at acquisition date. The straight-line
method of depreciation is used for financial reporting purposes. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill represents the excess of a purchase
price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired by the Company. Goodwill
is tested for impairment annually or more often if impairment indicators are present at the reporting unit level. The Company has
elected January 1st as its annual goodwill impairment assessment date. If the existence of events or circumstances indicates
that it is more likely than not that fair values of the reporting units are below their carrying values, the Company performs additional
impairment tests during interim periods to evaluate goodwill for impairment. 

Deposits 

Deposits consist of a security deposit
in connection with various office leases. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

The Company evaluates its long-lived assets
for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Asset
impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying
amount of the asset. Any impairment losses are measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows and are
charged to income on the Company s consolidated statements of operations. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped
at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset
groups. The Company s estimates of future cash flows are based on numerous assumptions, including expected commodity prices,
production levels, capital requirements and estimated salvage values. It is possible that actual future cash flows will be significantly
different than the estimates, as actual future quantities of recoverable material, future commodity prices, production levels and
costs and capital are each subject to significant risks and uncertainties. As of June 30, 2019, the Company s mineral resources
do not meet the definition of proven or probable reserves or value beyond proven or probable reserves and any potential revenue
has been excluded from the cash flow assumptions. Accordingly, recoverability of the long-lived assets capitalized
cost is based primarily on estimated salvage values or alternative future uses. 

Accrued Reclamation Liability 

The Company incurs reclamation liabilities
as part of its mining activities. Quarry activities require the removal and relocation of significant levels of overburden to access
materials of usable quantity and quality. The same overburden material is used to reclaim depleted mine areas, which must be sloped
to a certain gradient and seeded to prevent erosion in the future. Reclamation methods and requirements can differ depending on
the quarry and state rules and regulations in existence for certain locations. As of June 30, 2019, the Company s undiscounted
reclamation obligations totaled approximately 221,081. This obligation is expected to be settled within the next 20 years. 

Reclamation costs resulting from the normal
use of long-lived assets, either owned or leased, are recognized over the period the asset is in use. The obligation, which cannot
be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows, is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted
through charges to selling, general and administrative costs, inclusive of depreciation, depletion and amortization. The fair value
is based on our estimate of the cost required for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation tasks including a reasonable
profit margin. This fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over
the estimated useful life of the asset. 

The mining reclamation reserve is based
on management s estimate of future cost requirements to reclaim property at its operating quarry site. Costs are estimated
in current dollars and inflated until the expected time of payment using a future estimated inflation rate and then discounted
back to present value using a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate on obligations of similar maturity adjusted to reflect our credit
rating. The Company will review reclamation liabilities at least every three years for a revision to the cost or a change in the
estimated settlement date. Additionally, reclamation liabilities are reviewed in the period in which a triggering event occurs
that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Examples of events that would
trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment to an existing mineral lease. Examples of events that would
cause a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or early or delayed closure of a
site. Any affect to earnings from cost revisions is included in cost of revenue. 

A reconciliation of the carrying amount
of our accrued reclamation liabilities is as follows: 

Balance at April 1, 2019 
 60,990 
 
 Liabilities incurred 
 - 
 
 Accretion expense 
 1,488 
 
 Balance at June 30, 2019

Fair Value Measurements 

The fair value of a financial instrument
is the amount that could be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked
to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. A fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize
the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. Categorization within the fair value hierarchy
is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is defined
into the following three categories: 

- Level 1: Quoted market prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities 

 - Level 2: Observable market-based inputs
or inputs that are corroborated by market data 

 - Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are
not corroborated by market data 

The fair value of notes payable was 1,059,466 and 0 as at
June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019 respectively. 

Net Loss per Common Share 

Basic net loss per common share is calculated
by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period, without consideration for the potentially dilutive effects of converting stock options or restricted stock purchase
rights outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and the potential dilutive effects of stock options
or restricted stock purchase rights outstanding during the period determined using the treasury stock method. There are no such
anti-dilutive common share equivalents outstanding as June 30, 2019 which were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per
common share. 

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes under
the asset and liability method, which requires, among other things, that deferred income taxes be provided for temporary differences
between the tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities and their financial statement reported amounts. Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the financial statements and tax basis
of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The
effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. 

A valuation allowance is recorded by the
Company when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such a
determination, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable
temporary differences, projected future taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the
amount of the valuation allowance. When the Company establishes or reduces the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets,
its provision for income taxes will increase or decrease, respectively, in the period such determination is made. 

Additionally, the Company recognizes the
tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination
by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the financial statements
for a particular tax position is based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. Accordingly,
the Company establishes reserves for uncertain tax positions. The Company has not recognized interest or penalties in its statement
of operations and comprehensive loss since inception. 

Non-controlling Interests 

The Company s non-controlling interests
are interests in RMR Aggregates, Inc. not owned by the Company. The Company evaluates whether non-controlling interests are subject
to redemption features outside of its control. The amounts reported for non-controlling interests on the Company s Consolidated
Statements of Operations represent the portion of income or losses not attributable to the Company. 

F- 10 

NOTE C GOING CONCERN 

The Company's financial statements
are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern,
which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Under the going
concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the
intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to applicable laws
and regulations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its
assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company does not have sufficient cash or
other current assets, nor does it have an established and adequate source of revenues, to cover its operating costs and to
allow it to continue as a going concern. As a result, the Company s auditors issued a going concern opinion for the
financial statements at March 31, 2019. 

The ability of the Company to continue
as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the business plan and eventually attain profitable
operations. During the next year, the Company s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the
operations of its business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
and the payment of expenses associated with research and development. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required
to raise additional capital. 

Historically, the Company has mostly relied
upon funds from the sale of shares of stock and from acquiring loans to finance its operations and growth. Management may raise
additional capital through future public or private offerings of the Company s stock or through loans from private investors,
although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company s failure to do so could have
a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders. 

In the past year, the Company funded
operations by using cash proceeds received through the issuance of common and preferred stock and proceeds from debt financing. For
the coming year, the Company plans to continue to fund the Company through debt and securities sales and issuances until the
company generates enough revenues through the operations as stated above. 

F- 11 

The Company is currently working through
a number of opportunities to ensure the business will continue as a going concern. These include: 

1. 
 The
 development of the Rail Park will generate sustained annual revenues by providing transloading services and realized gains on
 the sale of land while limiting future capital development costs. 
 
 2. 
 Expansion of the Mid-Continent Quarry, which will allow greater volume production with limited fixed cost increases. 

NOTE D ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 

Accounts Receivable at June 30, 2019 was 241,273 compared to
 102,870 at March 31, 2019. The increase is due to a increase in production and product demand. No allowance is recorded, as all
items are current. 

NOTE E INVENTORY 

Inventory, which primarily represents finished goods, packaging
and fuel, are valued at the lower of cost (average) or market.

Selling general and administrative
costs for the three month period ended June 30, 2019 were 2,927,187 compared to 1,411,849 in the prior year. Increases in

NOTE N SEGMENT REPORTING 

Rocky Mountain Industrials, Inc (RMI)
has three reportable segments: aggregates, logistics and Rail Park. The aggregates segment produces chemical grade lime for
use in the aggregates market. The logistics segment is in the process of developing a rail access delivery location and will
generate sales through a combination of land sales as well as lease income and Rail services. The Rail Park segment will
require significant future capital injections before the segment will start generating recurring revenue. The Company expects
that the rail park development will conclude late in the Company s 2021 financial year or early in the Company s
2022 financial year. The aggregates segment relied significantly on sales to the West Elk Mine for the period
ended June 30, 2019. The sales to the West Elk Mine contributed 69 of revenue to this segment. 

The accounting policies of the segments
are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. RMI evaluates performance based on profit or
loss from operations before income taxes not including nonrecurring gains and losses. 

RMI accounts for intersegment sales and
transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third parties, that is, at current market prices. 

RMI s reportable segments are strategic
business units that offer different products and services. They are managed separately because each business requires different
technology and marketing strategies.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with
our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion
includes forward-looking statements for purposes of U.S. federal securities laws. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements . 

Overview 

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 6, 2012
under the name Online Yearbook with the principal business objective of developing and marketing online yearbooks
for schools, companies, and government agencies. 

On November 17, 2014, Rocky Mountain Resource Holdings, Inc. RMR became our majority shareholder by acquiring 5,200,000 shares of our common stock (the Shares ),
or 69.06 of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, pursuant to stock purchase agreements with Messrs. El Maraana
and Salah Blal, our former officers and directors. The Shares were acquired for an aggregate purchase price of 357,670. 

On December 8, 2014, we changed our name to RMR Industrials,
Inc. in connection with a change in our business plan. 

RMR Industrials, Inc. we , us , the
 Company or RMR is dedicated to operating industrial assets in the United States which include minerals,
materials, and services. Our vision is to become a key provider of industrial materials and services in the Rocky Mountain region.
We have a strategy to own, operate, develop, acquire and vertically integrate complementary industrial businesses. 

On February 27, 2015 (the Closing Date ), we entered
into and consummated a merger transaction pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement by and
among the Company, OLYB Acquisition Corporation, a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company Merger
Sub ), and RMR IP, Inc., a Nevada corporation RMR IP ). In accordance with the terms of Merger Agreement, on
the Closing Date, Merger Sub merged with and into RMR IP (the Merger ), with RMR IP surviving the Merger as our wholly
owned subsidiary. Chad Brownstein and Gregory M. Dangler are directors of the Company and co-owners of RMRH, which was the majority
shareholder of the Company prior to the Merger. Additionally, Messrs. Brownstein and Dangler were indirect controlling shareholders
and directors of RMR IP prior to the Merger. As such, the Merger was among entities under the common control of Messrs. Brownstein
and Dangler. 

On July 28, 2016, we formed RMR Aggregates, Inc., a Colorado
corporation RMR Aggregates ), as our wholly owned subsidiary. RMR Aggregates was formed to hold assets primarily
relating to the mining and processing of industrial minerals for the manufacturing, construction, and agriculture sectors. These
minerals include limestone, aggregates, marble, silica, barite, and sand. 

On October 12, 2016, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement
with CalX Minerals, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company CalX ), we completed the purchase of substantially
all of the assets associated with the business of operating the Mid-Continent Limestone Quarry on 41 BLM unpatented placer mining
claims in Garfield County, Colorado. CalX assets include the mining claims, improvements, access rights, water rights, equipment,
inventory, contracts, permits, certain intellectual property rights, and other tangible and intangible assets associated with the
limestone mining operation. The acquisition of these CalX assets will promote the development and implementation of the Company s
limestone mining operations in Colorado.

During January 2018, the Company formed Rail Land Company, LLC Rail Land Company as a wholly owned subsidiary to acquire and develop a rail terminal and services facility Rail
Park ). Rail Land Company purchased 620 acres of real estate located in Bennett, Colorado. The Company s development of the Rail Park is intended
to expand the Company s customer base for our products by utilizing rail freight capabilities to reach customers in the greater
Denver area and by expanding our business to include rail transportation solutions and services. 

On April 26, 2019 RMR Logistics entered into an asset
Purchase agreement with H2K, LLC, a Colorado Limited Liability Company the Seller pursuant to which RMR
Logistics acquired the sellers trucking assets. 

On January 1, 2020 we changed our name to Rocky Mountain

Results of Operations 

Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 and June
30, 2018 

Revenues 

Our revenues for the three-month period ended June 30, 2019
were 477,724. This compares to revenue for the same period ended June 30, 2018 of 329,614. The increase in revenues were driven
by the increased tons sold from the Company s Glenwood Springs mine. 

Cost of Goods Sold 

Our cost of goods sold for the three-month period ended June
30, 2019 were 421,300 This compares to cost of goods sold for the same period ended June 30, 2018 of 319,854. The increase in
costs related to increased production during the year. 

Operating Expenses 

Our operating expenses for the three-month period ended June
30, 2019 were 2,927,187. This compares to operating expenses for the same periods ended June 30, 2018 of 1,411,849. Operating
expenses consisted of overhead costs related to mining operations, consulting services from related parties, public company costs,
salaries and wages, and depreciation and amortization. The increase was due to increased head count coupled with costs incurred
by the Company in relation to the Company s rail park development. 

Interest Expense (Income), net 

Our interest expense, net for the three-month
period ended June 30, 2019 was 83,579, compared to 235,775 of interest expense for the same period ended June 30, 2019. The 2,250,000
note payable issued to an accredited investor in October 2016 was paid off on October 3, 2018. 

7 

Net Loss Attributable to Rocky Mountain
Industrials, Inc. 

Our net loss for the three-month period ended June 30, 2019
was 2,936,342. This compares to a net loss for the same period ended June 30, 2018 of 1,637,864. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of June 30, 2019, we had current assets of 1,376,373, total
current liabilities of 4,745,626 and working capital deficiency of 3,369,253. We have incurred an accumulated loss of 38,217,961
since inception. Our independent auditors issued an audit opinion for our financial statements for the fiscal year ended March
31, 2019 which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern due to our limited
liquidity and our lack of revenues. 

We will be seeking additional capital to execute our business
plan and reach positive cash flow from operations. Our base monthly expenses are approximately 200,000 per month. As evidenced
by approximately 1.2 million of our current liabilities being owed to related parties, we have relied historically on related
parties to sustain the Company s operations. In order to successfully execute our business plan, the net proceeds of a 10-20
million offering will be required to finance our planned acquisition and for general working capital purposes. 

We do not generate adequate cash flows to support our existing
operations. Moreover, the historical and existing capital structure is not adequate to fund our planned growth. Our current cash
requirements are significant due to our business plan which contemplates future acquisitions. We anticipate generating losses at
least through the 2020 fiscal year. We anticipate that we will be able to raise sufficient amounts of working capital in the near
term through debt or equity offerings as may be required to meet short-term obligations. 

Other than as stated above, we currently do not have any arrangements
for additional financing, and we may not be able to obtain financing when required. Our future is dependent upon our ability to
obtain financing, a successful marketing and promotion program, and, further in the future, achieving a profitable level of operations.
Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. We
will require additional funds to maintain our reporting status with the SEC and remain in good standing with the state of Nevada.
There are no assurances that we will be able to raise the required working capital on favorable terms, in a timely manner or at
all. Any failure to secure additional financing may force us to modify our business plan. In addition, we cannot be assured of
profitability in the future. 

Going Concern 

We have incurred net losses since our inception on October 15,
2014 through June 30, 2019 totaling 38,217,961 and have completed the preliminary stages of our business plan. We anticipate
incurring additional losses before realizing any revenues and will depend on additional financing in order to meet our continuing
obligations and ultimately to attain profitability. Our ability to obtain additional financing, whether through the
issuance of additional equity or through the assumption of debt, is uncertain. Accordingly, our independent auditors 
report on our financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 includes an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns
about our ability to continue as a going concern, including additional information contained in the notes to our financial statements
describing the circumstances leading to this disclosure. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue our business. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

We do not expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting
pronouncements to have a significant impact on our net results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 

8 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk 

Not Required 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted
an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective due to the material weakness described below. 

In light of the material weakness described below, we performed
additional analysis and other post-closing procedures to ensure that our condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, we believe that the condensed consolidated financial
statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows for the periods presented. 

Material Weakness and Related Remediation Initiatives 

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that as of June 30, 2019, there was a material weakness in our
internal control over financial reporting in that, due to budget constraints, the Company s accounting department does not
have sufficient accounting personnel (either in-house or external) necessary to ensure that complete and effective financial reporting
controls are designed and implemented. Accordingly, we did not perform timely and sufficient internal or external review of our
current fiscal year financial reporting, which resulted in untimely financial statement filings. 

Remediation of Internal Control Deficiencies and Expenditures 

We are developing a plan to address this material weakness,
which includes hiring qualified accounting personnel and establishing a formal audit committee. We are uncertain at this time of
the costs necessary to remediate the material weakness. Once implemented, remedial controls will have to be in place for at least
several quarters before management is able to conclude that the material weakness has been remediated. We intend to continue to
evaluate and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting systems. These efforts require significant time and resources.
If we are unable to establish adequate internal control over financial reporting systems, we may encounter difficulties in the
audit or review of our financial statements by our independent registered public accounting firm, which in turn may have a material
adverse effect on our ability to prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP and to comply with our SEC reporting obligations. 

9 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2019
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 95 

Mine Safety
Disclosures 

The operation of
the Company s aggregate mine is subject to regulation by the Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA under
the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act ). MSHA inspects the Company s mine on a regular
basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. Whenever MSHA issues
a citation or order, it also generally proposes a civil penalty, or fine, related to the alleged violation. Citations or orders
can be contested and appealed, and as part of that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. 

Under the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ), the Company is required to present information
regarding certain mining safety and health citations which MSHA has issued with respect to its aggregates mining operations in
its periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). In evaluating this information,
consideration should be given to factors such as: (i) the number of citations and orders will vary depending on the size of
the quarry or mine and type of operations (underground or surface), (ii) the number of citations issued will vary from inspector
to inspector and location to location, and (iii) citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and in that process,
may be reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. 

The Company presents
the following items regarding certain mining safety and health matters for the three months ended June 30, 2019: 

Total number of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a mine safety or health hazard under section 104 of the Mine Act for which the Company received a citation from MSHA (hereinafter, Section 104 S S Citations ). If MSHA determines that a violation of a mandatory health or safety standard is reasonably likely to result in a reasonably serious injury or illness under the unique circumstance contributed to by the violation, MSHA will classify the violation as a significant and substantial violation (commonly referred to as a S S violation). MSHA inspectors will classify each citation or order written as a S S violation or not. 

Total number of orders issued under section 104(b) of the Mine Act (hereinafter, Section 104(b) Orders ). These orders are issued for situations in which MSHA determines a previous violation covered by a Section 104(a) citation has not been totally abated within the prescribed time period, so a further order is needed to require the mine operator to immediately withdraw all persons (except certain authorized persons) from the affected area of a quarry or mine. 

Total number of citations and orders for unwarrantable failure of the mine operator to comply with mandatory health or safety standards under Section 104(d) of the Mine Act (hereinafter, Section 104(d) Citations and Orders ). These violations are similar to those described above, but the standard is that the violation could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a safety or health hazard, but the conditions do not cause imminent danger, and the MSHA inspector finds that the violation is caused by an unwarranted failure of the operator to comply with the health and safety standards. 

Total number of flagrant violations under section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act (hereinafter, Section 110(b)(2) Violations ). These violations are penalty violations issued if MSHA determines that violations are flagrant , for which civil penalties may be assessed. A flagrant violation means a reckless or repeated failure to make reasonable efforts to eliminate a known violation of a mandatory health or safety standard that substantially and proximately caused, or reasonably could have been expected to cause, death or serious bodily injury. 

Total number of imminent danger orders issued under section 107(a) of the Mine Act (hereinafter, Section 107(a) Orders ). These orders are issued for situations in which MSHA determines an imminent danger exists in the quarry or mine and results in orders of immediate withdrawal of all persons (except certain authorized persons) from the area of the quarry or mine affected by its condition until the imminent danger and the underlying conditions causing the imminent danger no longer exist. 

Total Dollar Value of MSHA Assessments Proposed. These are the amounts of proposed assessments issued by MSHA with each citation or order for the time period covered by the report. Penalties are assessed by MSHA according to a formula that considers a number of factors, including the mine operator s history, size, negligence, gravity of the violation, good faith in trying to correct the violation promptly, and the effect of the penalty on the operator s ability to continue in business. 

Total Number of Mining-Related Fatalities. Mines subject to the Mine Act are required to report all fatalities occurring at their facilities unless the fatality is determined to be non-chargeable to the mining industry. The final rules of the SEC require disclosure of mining-related fatalities at mines subject to the Mine Act. Only fatalities determined by MSHA not to be mining-related may be excluded. 

Receipt of written notice from MSHA of a pattern (or a potential to have such a pattern) of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that are of such nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of other mine health or safety hazards under section 104(e) of the Mine Act. If MHSA determines that a mine has a pattern of these types of violations, or the potential to have such a pattern, MSHA is required to notify the mine operator of the existence of such a thing.
