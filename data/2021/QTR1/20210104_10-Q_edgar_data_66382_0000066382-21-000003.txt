The Company considered multiple factors in determining the fair value of the previously held equity method investment, including the price negotiated with the selling shareholder for the 34 equity interest in HAY, an income valuation model (discounted cash flow) and current trading multiples for comparable companies. Based on this analysis, the Company recognized an immaterial non-taxable gain on the remeasurement of the previously held equity method investment of million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020.

 Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit has more likely than not declined below its carrying value. When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company may first assess qualitative factors. If an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, additional quantitative testing is performed. The Company may also elect to bypass the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. If the quantitative testing indicates that goodwill is impaired, the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value. 
 
 Each of the reporting units were reviewed for impairment using a quantitative assessment as of March 31, 2020, our annual testing date. In performing the quantitative impairment test, the Company determined that the fair value of the North America and International reporting units exceeded the carrying amount and, as such, these reporting units were not impaired. The assessment of the Retail and Maharam reporting units indicated that the carrying value of these reporting units exceeded their fair values, and goodwill impairment charges of million and million, respectively, were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 resulting in no goodwill remaining in either the Retail or Maharam reporting units. Accumulated goodwill impairment losses were million as of November 28, 2020 and May 30, 2020. 
 
 The fair value of the Company's International reporting unit, which includes million of goodwill as of May 30, 2020, exceeded its carrying value by . Due to the level that the reporting unit fair value exceeded the carrying amount and the results of the sensitivity analysis, the Company may need to record an impairment charge if the operating results of its International reporting unit were to decline in future periods. 
 
 Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization and are evaluated annually for impairment, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable. 
 
 In fiscal 2020, the Company performed quantitative assessments in testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, which resulted in the carrying values of the DWR, Maharam, HAY and naughtone trade names exceeding their fair values by million, and impairment charges of this amount were recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. If the residual cash flows related to these trade names were to decline in future periods, the Company may need to record an additional impairment charge.

 and , respectively, for the three month periods ended November 28, 2020 and November 30, 2019. The same period in the prior year included a non-taxable gain on consolidation of an equity method investment which is the primary driver of the year over year increase in the effective tax rate. For the three months ended November 28, 2020, the effective tax rate is higher than the United States federal statutory rate due to United States state income taxes and the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions that had rates that were higher than the United States federal statutory rate. For the three months ended November 30, 2019, the effective tax rate was lower than the United States federal statutory rate mainly as a result from the impact of a non-taxable gain on consolidation of an equity method investment.

The Company does not sell or otherwise issue warranties or warranty extensions as stand-alone products. Reserves have been established for various costs associated with the Company's warranty program.

The Company provides an assurance-type warranty that ensures that products will function as intended. As such, the Company's estimated warranty obligation is accounted for as a liability and is recorded within current and long-term liabilities within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Item 2: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 (Dollars in millions, except share data) 
 
 The following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that affected the Company's financial condition, earnings and cash flows during the periods included in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and should be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 30, 2020. References to Notes are to the footnotes included in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Business Overview 
 The Company researches, designs, manufactures, sells, and distributes furnishings and accessories, for use in various environments including office, healthcare, educational, and residential settings, and provides related services that support companies all over the world. The Company's products are sold primarily through independent contract office furniture dealers as well as the following channels: owned contract office furniture dealers, direct customer sales, independent retailers, owned retail studios and stores, direct-mail catalogs and the Company's e-commerce platforms. The following is a summary of results for the three months ended November 28, 2020: 
 
 Net sales were 626.3 million and orders were 629.7 million, representing a decrease of 7.1 and 6.7 , respectively, when compared to the same quarter of the prior year. The decrease in net sales was driven primarily by decreased sales volumes in the North America Contract segment, partially offset by increased demand within the Retail segment and the acquisitions of HAY and naughtone. On an organic basis, net sales were 573.5 million ) and orders were 572.2 million, representing a decrease of 14.9 ) and 15.2 , respectively, when compared to the same quarter of the prior year. 
 
 Gross margin was 39.0 as compared to 37.9 for the same quarter of the prior year. The increase in gross margin was driven primarily by favorable channel and product sales mix partially offset by lower overhead leverage due to decreased volumes. 
 
 Operating expenses decreased by 19.9 million or 10.3 as compared to the same quarter of the prior year. The decrease in operating expenses was driven primarily by lower compensation and benefit costs, lower marketing and selling costs, and lower travel costs. 
 
 The effective tax rate was 23.5 compared to 14.3 for the same quarter of the prior year. The same period in the prior year included a non-taxable gain on consolidation of an equity method investment which is the primary driver of the year over year increase in the effective tax rate. 
 
 Diluted earnings per share were 0.87, a 34.1 decrease as compared to the prior year. Excluding restructuring expenses and other special charges, adjusted diluted earnings per share were 0.89 ) , a 1.1 increase as compared to prior year adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
 
 ) Non-GAAP measurements; see accompanying reconciliations and explanations. 
 
 The following summary includes the Company's view on the economic environment in which it operates: 
 
 The Company's Retail segment supports a range of furniture categories aimed at the home environment. Several of these categories, including Upholstery, Outdoor, Storage, and Accessories, saw a ramp-up in demand during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and this continued into the second quarter of fiscal 2021. 
 
 The disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted the results of our second quarter as industry order trends, as reported by the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturers Association ("BIFMA"), have highlighted near-term demand pressures from the slowdown in economic activity from the pandemic in 
 Herman Miller, Inc. and Subsidiaries 25 

our North America Contract segment. Our International Contract segment has also been impacted, though many of the markets internationally have shown signs of faster economic recovery. 
 
 The Company is monitoring the resolution of various trade policy negotiations between the U.S. and key trading partners as well as the ongoing negotiations concerning the U.K. referendum to exit the European Union ("Brexit"). These negotiations create uncertainty in key markets, particularly the U.K., continental Europe and China, which, if unresolved in the near term, could negatively impact customer demand. 
 
 The Company continues to navigate the impact of global tariffs. The Company believes, based upon existing circumstances, that pricing, strategic sourcing actions and profit optimization initiatives have fully offset the current level of tariffs imposed on imports from China. 
 
 The Company's financial performance is sensitive to changes in certain input costs, including steel and steel component parts. The market price of steel in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was lower than the same period of the prior year and favorably impacted consolidated results on a year-over-year basis. However, the price of steel increased towards the end of the quarter and has the potential to unfavorably impact consolidated gross margin in the second half of fiscal 2021. 
 
 The remaining sections within Item 2 include additional analysis of the three and six months ended November 28, 2020, including discussion of significant variances compared to the prior year periods. 

COVID-19 Update 
 The Company continues to respond to the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Workplace restrictions are regionally applied based on the recommendations of local government and health authorities. While demand for the Company's products and services, particularly in the Contract channel of the business has been adversely impacted, our multi-channel go-to-market approach has enabled us to serve customers where, and how, they need to be served. In addition, the investments we ve made in people, technology, and products has positioned us well to capitalize on emerging opportunities as our customers' needs changed quickly at the onset of the COVID-19 crisis. This has allowed for our Retail business to take advantage of the unanticipated emerging work-from-home trend as consumers are focusing on their broader home environments. Despite this, the extent of the geographic spread and duration of this virus, the impact on our supply chain, future demand for our products, and related financial impact cannot be estimated at this time with any degree of certainty. 
 
 Employee Safety and Health 
 The health and well-being of employees remains top of mind. We are taking a regional approach to restrictions based on active COVID-19 case levels and local health authority recommendations. Contact tracing is active in all regions to help track and control the spread of the virus. We also continue to employ a variety of other safety measures including domestic and international travel restrictions, extensive cleaning protocols, temperature and health screenings, personal protective equipment, and visitor safety guidelines. 
 
 Customer Focus 
 The digital investments we ve made allowed us to pivot quickly and capitalize on a new set of opportunities when our customers purchasing behaviors changed. These investments include a reimagined Design Within Reach website, a Work from Home landing page on Herman Miller s website, a Work from Home online assessment tool, and new digital platforms that are creating greater efficiencies for contract and dealer audiences. Perhaps most notable for the quarter, our first Herman Miller retail seating concept stores opened in Los Angeles and New York City. In the early days, these stores have exceeded our expectations as we seek to educate customers about the health benefits of ergonomic seating. We are uniquely positioned to serve our customers through multiple channels with the most comprehensive portfolio of products in the industry. We are confident in our ability to partner with them to solve for the next generation workplace by providing authentic modern designs for their workplaces and their homes.

Manufacturing and Retail Operations 
 Manufacturing facilities continue to operate at near-normal capacity with enhanced safety precautions. Nearly all retail studios and stores are open in some capacity; with some open to the public, some in limited capacity, and others by appointment only. All facilities operate within the context and subject to local guidance from government and health authorities and we will continue to adjust to ensure we are acting in accordance with these guidelines. 
 
 Cost Reductions 
 In fiscal 2020, the Company implemented a range of actions aimed at temporarily reducing costs and preserving liquidity. In fiscal 2021, the Company, together with its Board of Directors, made the decision to move forward with several restorative actions. This included eliminating the 10 reduction in compensation, the introduction of a modified bonus program and re-establishing a quarterly cash dividend program. In addition, the Company has elected to reinstate the previously suspended retirement plan contributions starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The Company continues to tightly control operating expenses in the face of lingering economic uncertainty. 

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 This report contains references to organic net sales and adjusted earnings per share - diluted, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Organic growth (decline) represents the change in net sales, excluding currency translation effects and the impact of acquisitions. Adjusted earnings per share represents reported diluted earnings per share excluding the impact from adjustments related to restructuring expenses and other special charges or gains, including related taxes. Restructuring expenses in the current period included actions involving facilities consolidation and optimization and targeted workforce reductions, while in the comparative period included actions involving facilities consolidation and optimization and costs associated with an early retirement program. 
 
 The Company believes presenting organic net sales and adjusted earnings per share - diluted is useful for investors as it provides financial information on a more comparative basis for the periods presented by excluding items that are not representative of the ongoing operations of the Company. 
 
 Organic net sales and adjusted earnings per share - diluted are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to the related GAAP measurement. These non-GAAP measurements have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our presentation of non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items. We compensate for these limitations by providing prominence of our GAAP results and using the non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement.

Cash Flows - Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended November 28, 2020 was 214.6 million, as compared to 142.4 million in the same period of the prior year. The increase in cash generated from operations in the current year, compared to the prior year, was primarily due to: 
 
 Prior year net earnings which included a non-taxable non-cash gain on consolidation of an equity method investment of 30.5 million; and 
 An increase in current liabilities in the current period of 22.9 million, driven primarily by an increase in accounts payable. This compares to a decrease in current liabilities of 21.1 million in the prior year period. The decrease in the prior year period was driven primarily by a decrease in accrued liabilities; offset by 
 A decrease in current assets in the current period of 2.3 million, driven by a decrease in inventory and prepaid expenses, offset by an increase in accounts receivable. This compares to a decrease in current assets of 16.5 million in the prior year period. 
 
 Cash Flows - Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended November 28, 2020 was 24.4 million, as compared to 82.1 million in the same period of the prior year. The decrease in cash outflow in the current year, compared to the prior year, was primarily due to: 
 
 Prior year cash outflow of 40.0 million for the purchase of naughtone; 
 A decrease in capital expenditures of 14.2 million due to reduced spending as a result of COVID-19; and 
 Proceeds from the sale of the Company's manufacturing facility in China and office facility in the United Kingdom in the current year of 11.4 million. 
 
 At the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2021, there were outstanding commitments for capital purchases of 16.3 million. The Company plans to fund these commitments through a combination of cash on hand and cash flows from operations. The Company expects full-year capital purchases to be between 50.0 million and 60.0 million, which will be primarily related to investments in the Company's facilities and equipment. This com pares to full-year capital spending of 69.0 million in fiscal 2020. 
 
 Cash Flows - Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended November 28, 2020 was 276.9 million, as compared to 40.6 million in the sa me period of the prior year. The increase in cash outflow in the current year, compared to the prior year, was primarily due to repayments of 265.0 million on the Company's credit facility in June 2020. 
 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 In addition to steps taken to protect its workforce and manage business operations, the Company has taken actions to safeguard its capital position in the current environment. The Company is closely managing spending levels, capital investments, and working capital, and has temporarily suspended open market share repurchase activity as part of managing cash flows. For more information on current cost reductions, refer to the COVID-19 Update section above. 
 
 At the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company had a well-positioned balance sheet and liquidity profile. In addition to cash flows from operating activities, the Company has access to liquidity through credit facilities, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. These sources have been summarized below. For additional information, refer to Note 14 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Herman Miller, Inc. and Subsidiaries 37 

Of the cash and cash equivalents noted above at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company had 176.4 million of cash and cash equivalents held outside the United States. In addition, the Company had marketable securities of 7.2 million held by one of its international wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
 
 The Company s syndicated revolving line of credit, which expires on August 28, 2024, provides the Company with up to 500 million in revolving variable interest borrowing capacity and includes an "accordion feature" allowing the Company to increase, at its option and subject to the approval of the participating banks, the aggregate borrowing capacity of the facility by up to 250 million. Outstanding borrowings bear interest at rates based on the prime rate, federal funds rate, LIBOR or negotiated rates as outlined in the agreement. Interest is payable periodically throughout the period if borrowings are outstanding. 
 
 As of November 28, 2020, the total debt outstanding related to borrowings under the syndicated revolving line of credit was 225.0 million with available borrowings against this facility of 265.2 million. 
 
 The subsidiary holding the Company's marketable securities is taxed as a United States taxpayer at the Company's election. Consequently, for tax purposes, all United States tax impacts for this subsidiary have been recorded. The Company intends to repatriate 26.7 million in cash held in certain foreign jurisdictions over the next two years and as such has recorded a deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding taxes on these future dividends received in the U.S. from foreign subsidiaries of 1.8 million. A significant portion of this cash was previously taxed under the U.S. Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) one-time U.S. tax liability on undistributed foreign earnings. The Company intends to remain indefinitely reinvested in the remaining undistributed earnings outside the U.S. 
 
 The Company believes that its financial resources will allow it to manage the impact of COVID-19 on business operations for the foreseeable future which could include materially reduced revenue and profits. The Company will continue to evaluate its financial position in light of future developments, particularly those relating to COVID-19. 

Contractual Obligations 
 Contractual obligations associated with ongoing business and financing activities will require cash payments in future periods. A table summarizing the amounts and estimated timing of these future cash payments as of May 30, 2020 was provided in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 30, 2020.

Safe Harbor Provisions 
 Certain statements in this filing are not historical facts but are forward-looking statements as defined under Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended, that are based on management s beliefs, assumptions, current expectations, estimates, and projections about the office furniture industry, the economy, and the Company itself. Words like anticipates, believes, confident, estimates, expects, forecasts, likely, plans, projects, and should, variations of such words, and similar expressions identify such forward-looking statements. These statements do not guarantee future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict with regard to timing, extent, likelihood, and degree of occurrence. These risks include, without limitation, the success of our growth strategy, employment and general economic conditions, the pace of economic growth in the U.S., and in our International markets, the potential impact of changes in U.S. tax law, the increase in white collar employment, the willingness of customers to undertake capital expenditures, the types of products purchased by customers, competitive-pricing pressures, the availability and pricing of raw materials, our reliance on a limited number of suppliers, our ability to expand globally given the risks associated with regulatory and legal compliance challenges and accompanying currency fluctuations, the ability to increase prices to absorb the additional costs of raw materials, the financial strength of our dealers and the financial strength of our customers, our ability to locate new DWR, HAY, and Herman Miller retail stores and studios, negotiate favorable lease terms for new and existing locations and the implementation of our studio portfolio transformation, our ability to attract and retain key executives and other qualified employees, our ability to continue to make product innovations, the success of newly-introduced products, our ability to serve all of our markets, possible acquisitions, divestitures or alliances, the pace and level of government procurement, the outcome of pending litigation or governmental audits or investigations, political risk in the markets we serve, natural disasters, public health crises, disease outbreaks, and other risks identified in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Therefore, actual results and outcomes may materially differ from what we express or forecast. Furthermore, Herman Miller, Inc., undertakes no obligation to update, amend or clarify forward-looking statements. 

Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The information concerning quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended May 30, 2020 has not changed significantly. The nature of market risks from interest rates and commodity prices has not changed materially during the first six months of fiscal 2021. 
 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 The Company primarily manufactures its products in the United States, United Kingdom, China and India. It also sources completed products and product components from outside the United States. The Company's completed products are sold in numerous countries around the world. Sales in foreign countries as well as certain expenses related to those sales are transacted in currencies other than the Company's reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, production costs and profit margins related to these sales are affected by the currency exchange relationship between the countries where the sales take place and the countries where the products are sourced or manufactured. These currency exchange relationships can also impact the Company's competitive positions within these markets. 
 
 In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts denominated in foreign currencies. The principal foreign currencies in which the Company conducts its business are the British pound sterling, euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Hong Kong dollar, Chinese renminbi, and the Danish krone. Changes in the fair value of such contracts are reported in earnings in the period the value of the contract changes. The net gain or loss upon settlement and the change in fair value of outstanding contracts is recorded as a component of Other (income) expense, net.
