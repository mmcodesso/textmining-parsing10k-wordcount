THE SEC COMMISSION CONFIRMED OUR FORM RW ON 12/21/2020.

______________________________________________________________

My Dear Shareholders, OTC Markets Directors, colleagues at FINRA, and to the
Esteemed Commissioners of the SEC, and of course, to my Chiefs at Section 11
at the SEC,

CURRENT UPDATE...as of January 4th, 2021.

Our Director is called many names on message boards...and today, in 2021 we
bow our heads to all decision makers at OTC Markets in our quest to
re-apply to the PINK CURRENT INFO tier status.
This is a reapplication to occur on January 24th, 2021.

WE ONLY HAVE COMMON STOCK IN OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE 

 WE DO NOT HAVE CONVERTIBLE NOTES or WARRANTS 

 WE HAVE ZERO LONG TERM DEBT 

 ACCR DOES NOT BELIEVE IN PROMOTION 

It is very expensive to hire a PCAOB registered firm/accountant/attorneys
for our
micro-cap operations. However, we will succeed in capturing all of the
requirements
of all the SEC Rules of '33 and '34, as best as we can.

We are fully aware of the FINAL RULE imposed by the SEC, by September
21st, 2021 to require movement of all PINK NO INFORMATION
tier companies to the grey market today called the EXPERT MARKET.

We are pleading with all the Directors at OTC Markets to please be fair to our
Company. We will re-apply with OTC Markets on January 24, 2021 to become
PINK CURRENT INFORMATION tier again, as we once were in 2008.
The only reason why there is a RED STOP SIGN is because of a discussed
CRIMINAL FORM 15 filed by our previous inept managers in 2007.
We charge our past managers naked short sold our
shares into the ground. Their intent was to carve all the equity
off the bone, and then to file the CRIMINAL FORM 15 in 2007
as their criminal strategy.

We provide full disclosure to our
Market Makers, and to our investing community.

We have the Spirit of a Warrior, and our Corporation has done nothing wrong.
All of the Company press releases can be found here:

http://www.globenewswire.com

We have learned that in 2021, all OTC Markets PINK CURRENT
INFORMATION
tier Companies will have at chance at Solicited Quotes for the first time in
over 12.5
years. We will not be needing to obtain a FORM 211 with FINRA. We
have received
news that in 2021, only selected PINK CURRENT INFORMATION tier
companies
will receive a shot at SOLICITED QUOTES by a market maker.

ACCR believes to have an excellent relationship with our primary Market
Maker over
the years. Our primary market maker signed the UNSOLICITED
QUOTE FORM
with OTC Markets pre-October 18, 2019.

We are loyal to our Shareholder base.

Our story...from Inception through March 1, 2012, the Company was
a violent
victim of a terrible financial crime. The criminals behind this scheme
to defraud
investors was planned very methodically.

We have many shareholders placed in restrictive shares...none of
which have
SURFACED in do a 144a sale in over 2 decades. Why is this?
Management believes that all 100 share lot's of restrictive shares were
issued
in fraud, and to fictitious people, or Shareholders - totaling over
15,000,000
shares in never to be claimed restrictive shares.
It was pre-meditated and
very detail in CRIME.

The criminals of the past perpetraded a MASTERMIND financial
crime against
our Shareholder base. We seek retribution from our past fraud managers.
We
recently learned that one of our past fraud managers lives in Nashville
area of
TN in a 5.2 million dollar house in September 2020. We charge
he used SEC
filings to commit financial crimes against our Shareholders. We
nearly have
15,000,000 shares in RESTRICTED STATUS 100 share lots's....
the previous
criminal masterminds.

WE SEEK RETROBUTION FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS

We charge this man used SEC filings going back to 2002 to commit financial
crimes
against our Shareholders. Today, we are the cleanest OTC Companies
around.

The Company made 2 FINRA DAILY lists on 5/6/2020 and on 9/6/2018.

The Company has had discussions with the SEC regarding a FRAUD
FORM 15 that was filed by previous management in 2007. We believe
that we have a fiduciary responsibility to report transparent
information to our Shareholders.

We were victims of toxic death spiral debentures from 1998 to
2008 and through March 2012.

PLEASE FORGIVE OUR PAST.

ACCR as a structure TODAY is very sound, because I am in charge.
ACCR has life only today because of ME.

The past is the past, and
we wish to move forward with a plan to become fully
current with the SEC in 2021. We are trying the best we can within the
Spirit of the Law. We will be refiling our FORM 10 very soon...very
soon.

On October 18, 2019, our Company was in the FIRST GROUP of
Equities to bust
out of the death grey market, where we stayed there for 11 years
after our
criminal FORM 15 was filed by previous criminal management.

Let's move forward, and for get the PAST!

Prior to October 18, 2019...we had DEATH....today, we have LIFE, and
we have a
direction on how to fix this trajedy. Today we have visible Level 2
QUOTES. We
have already spent 11 years in the DEATH DARK GREY MARKET.

Please,,,why should we go back? We will NOT go back, ever.

TODAY, we have LIFE.

Our primary Market Maker signed a new form created with OTC
Markets in 2019.
This form is located here...we believe to have a wonderful relationship
with our
PRIMARY MARKET MAKER.

https://www.otcmarkets.com/files/unsolicited-quote-form-1514935916031.pdf

We jumped from the deathly grey market to the PINK NO INFORMATION
tier of
OTC Markets on this infamous date in our history, October 18, 2019.
We have lived
in this tier with NO DILUTION for over a year with no harm to our
Shareholders.

WE LOVE OUR SHAREHOLDERS, and believe in RAISING
SHAREHOLDER
VALUE. WE VALUE OUR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS.

ACCR received a denial to go PINK CURRENT TIER on July 23, 2020.
Why? We
submitted every form in a satisfactory manner. We CLASHED with our prior
accountant whom shall remain nameless. We clashed hard. Why were we
denied
to go PINK CURRENT is a mystery to us. Maybe our prior attorney said bad
things
about our Company to OTC Markets, I do not know why. He threatened to
call OTC
MARKETS, and call me a liar, when he was the liar.

We do not know. We've been told that OTC Markets did not like our
Company 8K's
nor our Company story. ACCR has contacted OTC Markets, and on
July 23,
2020 we received the following reply:

On July 23, 2020 3:30 PM Liz Heese wrote:

Mr. Jensen,

OTC Markets has reached a final determination to deny your application
for access

public interest
concerns associated with the company and its disclosure, including but

We consider this matter to be closed and will not engage in further discussion
at this
time. As stated in the email from Nancy Rodriguez, you may reapply

in 6 months.

THEREFORE, ACCR is going to re-apply to become PINK CURRENT
INFORMATION TIER on January 24, 2021.

ACCR as a Corporation is perfectly
clean, and has done nothing wrong. We've just had bad management.
All the
Amendments and Articles of Incorp all check out at:

ACCR has done nothing wrong. ACCR will get SOLICITED QUOTES
again in 2021.

CURRENT MANAGEMENT WILL STEP DOWN TO CLEAR A PATHWAY
FOR OTHERS

Let's just forget this past CRIMINAL FORM 15, that according to the SEC
cannot
be changed, and our only option is today to re-file our FORM 10 properly
with the help of counsel, and we will.

WE ARE WORKING ON A REVERSE MERGER...we plan to audit the

This FORM
4 filing is on file with the SEC. There are currently a total of 98,374,146
ESTIMATED shares registered in our float.

Management continues to believe that there is a massive short position
in our Company stock that was accumulated from 1999 to 2008, and we
estimate this short position to be massive extended through the
present day.

It is not the fault of the Company. We never comment on price, but our
Director
believes in rooting for our Shareholders.

We value our COMMON STOCK...Our Company stock FLOAT is
substantially
lower than the official 98,374,146 shares reported to OTC Markets.

We care about our Shareholders dearly, and our top priority is investor
protection. There is NO DILUTION IN THE COMMON STOCK OF
ACCR.
Our Director wants to RAISE SHAREHOLDER VALUE the old
fashioned way through price discovery.

We seek a MONUMENTAL reverse merger in 2021."

Patrick

PART I

ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Access-Power & Co., Inc, is a for profit business looking for a
MERGER CANDIDATE. We believe that a REVERSE MERGER
candidate is ready to happen in 2021.

2020 was a bad year with the Biblical Covid-19 attack on mankind.
We believe this aggression will continue into 2021, and affect
consumer demand.

THE COMPANY HAS NOT HAD ANY CONSISTENT
REVENUE SINCE MAY 2020.

The Company struggled from May 1, 2019 to October 18, 2019. We had no
income during this period, and our operational expenses were paid for
by myself, Patrick J. Jensen as a donation to the Company. I personally
paid out of my own pocket all the expenses during this dark time,
EVEN TODAY.

On October 2, 2019---> I dreamed of getting off the greys. This is a fact.

The Company also operates many eCommerce websites at the present time.

https://www.clonesbydrones.com
https://www.clonesbycar.com (s)
https://www.mycbdpets.com

We continue to strive to build up our revenues. We want to succeed
and we will comeback to a higher reporting standard. On October 18,
2019 we were upgraded in trading tier from the dark grey market
to the PINK NO INFORMATION market. We have no intention of going
back to the grey market, as the Company currently trades on an
unsolicited basis in the PINK NO INFORMATION tier at OTC
Markets.

THERE IS RISK TO OUR PLAN.

OTC MARKETS COULD SAY NO...

OTC Markets could
deny our re-application again on January 24, 2021.

ACCR DOES NOT BELIEVE IN PROMOTION, we tried it once in
January 2020 and paid 70 in cash, and it was the worst
experience the Company ever had...what a dumb promoter. We were
curious because the guy came to us soliciting the dumb postings he would do.
We cancelled the relationship after 3 dismal daze days. He was posting
stuff from 1999 as current information...LOL.

The 70 bucks was unsolicited by the Company. We were just dumb and
curious at that one moment in time. We will NOT engage in this
type of activity again....not now. Please forgive our past mistakes...

ACCR has not sold 1 single share of stock in over a Decade
and ACCR does NOT believe in promotion ever. Our Director
became a US Disabled Citizen on August 20, 2020.

Access-Power & Co., Inc.'s revenue shortfalls are supported by personal
donations from Patrick J. Jensen, our Company Director.

We issued the following PRESS RELEASE on December 28th, 2020.

Access-Power & Co., Inc. affirms commitment to go PINK CURRENT
with OTC Markets on January 24, 2021

GRAND HAVEN, Mich., Dec. 28, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --
Access-Power & Co., Inc., ACCR or the Company, a Grand Haven
based diversified holding Company is pleased to announce a new plan to
get to the PINK CURRENT INFORMATION tier with OTC Markets,
and reapply by January 24th, 2021.

The company is fully aware of the steps involved to attain PINK
CURRENT tier by our re-application date of January 24, 2021. Our Director,
Patrick J
Jensen commented, it is with great pleasure that we affirm our commitment
to go
PINK CURRENT with OTC Markets. We have analyzed our requirements
to get
to this new tier. The requirements are found here,

https://www.otcmarkets.com/corporate-services/information-for-pink-
companies

Additionally, the Company is pleased to announce the hiring of a
consultant/accountant
to help bridge forward all of our financial statements. The Company, going into
2021,
is already set up with QUICKBOOKs in anticipation of this higher standard
for reporting.
Our accountant was hired on December 18, 2020. Our consultant/accountant
will also
be preparing our Financial Disclosure Reports to be filed with OTC Markets.

The Company expects all expenses to be covered. ACCR on 12/18/2020 wired
 2,500.00 to
the bank account of our hired accountant. Patrick J Jensen continued,
Our hired accountant
came to the Company as a result of a referral. We are pleased, and very
blessed to have this ANGEL come down and help our company.

Patrick further assures shareholders, ACCR expects good CASH FLOW
upcoming. Our
Director has made a commitment in writing to do another paid in capital
donation of 25,000.00
by the end of April 2021. We are pleased with the level of commitment that has
been
established with our Director, Patrick J Jensen.

Patrick commented, All ACCR expenses right now are covered. We
anticipate enough
cash to cover all upcoming expenses. ACCR will owe 2,500.00 to our
consultant in another
month. ACCR will owe OTC Markets another 1k application fee and another
 5.5k to
complete the yearly News & Disclosure Service of OTC Markets. In the
end, ACCR
expects to pass all requirements, and get PINK CURRENT.

Today, ACCR also has learned that MMs going forward will make selected
solicited quotes for all
Companies in the PINK CURRENT tier of OTC Markets. We want our
Shareholders to know, that
we see all of this coming, and expect to have enough cash to cover
all anticipated expenses with
continued ZERO LONG TERM DEBT in 2021, and only common stock in
our float.

ITEM 1a. RISK FACTORS

ACCR DOES NOT BELIEVE IN PROMOTION - PERIOD!

Access-Power & Co., Inc. sees RISK EVERYWHERE in this World of
Worry!

We have a consumer model that is 100percent legal and we believe our
Clones by Car business will be incredible. THERE IS NO DILUTION
IN OUR COMMON STOCK in 2021.

ACCR may have to re-classify ourselves, in future quarters, as a
SHELL COMPANY.

We are in control of the treasury of ACCR. We will
guard this treasury with our life, as we believe that NO DILUTION will
be very beneficial to our Shareholders over the long term. There
are no convertible debentures associated with ACCR.

ACCR has zero long term debt.

We have a strong set of bylaws.

Risk by our Director is mitigated.

ITEM 1b. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

NONE, we plan to re-file our FORM 10 very soon...THERE IS A GOOD
CHANCE THAT ACCR FOR THE FIRST TIME WILL BE MARKED
AS A SHELL.

REVENUE has been affected by Covid-19. We must
find another private company that is willing to carry some innocent weight
and use our Shell/Company to go public.

We will re-register our shares again in 2021 via our Form 10. We know
this ----> we plea wi the SEC please just give us some more time.

OUR REVERSE MERGER IS CRITICAL

ITEM 2. PROPERTY

There is not much property here...

ITEM 7.	 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONs

ACCR values our common shares, and we may buy them back in 2021.
We have a good
cash pile, and will use it as we see fit.

Our Director is a full time US Disabled Citizen as of August 8, 2020.
https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/faqs/soxact2002.htm
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes E2 80 93Oxley_Act

Access-Power & Co., Inc., is a Grand Haven,
MI based medical marijuana clone company on track to become Michigans
only manufacturer and distributor of medical marijuana clone products
delivered by https://www.clonesbycar.com (s). We are planning and
implementing to become a fully licensed operation in the State of Michigan.
Our seedvault includes famous strains such as Amnesia Haze...and
so many more.
We are in development of a new service
trademarked under the brand, Clones by Cars (TM), a method for
delivering marijuana and marijuana clones online across the nation by CARS!

Our beta website is www.clonesbycar.com (s). Additionally, the Company
offers a variety of calming pet products on its website
www.mycbdpets.com. Access-Power & Co., Inc. was formed in 1996 and is a
Florida-based profit Corporation. We only have common stock, and
the Corporation has zero debt and no convertible notes. NO WARRANTS.

Our
Shareholders will enjoy no dilution in our Common shares through
the end of 2021, specifically MARCH 2022.

Finally, Access-Power & Co., Inc., is seeking to merge
with another entity with experienced management to create value for
our shareholders. We can do anything in this world.

The Director is Actively looking for a MERGER DEAL.

ITEM 7a. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Access-Power & Co., Inc. is not concerned about market risk.
The Company has learned that in 2021, OTC Markets and Market Makers will
decide price discovery and entity certification
for achieving Solicited Quotes. We understand that the FORM 211 with FINRA
will be gone for all PINK CURRENT INFORMATION tier stocks.

The Solicited Quotes will happen on a select basis, and we believe to have an
EXCELLENT relationship with our Primary Market Maker.

We hope to make a MONUMENTAL deal in 2021 and maybe by the Fall 2021 refile our
FORM 10 with the SEC to ReRegister our shares according to all the Spirit in
all the laws of the Securities and Exchange Commission '33 & '34.

ITEM 8.	 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

See item 6.

(b) A smaller reporting company may provide the information
required by Article 8 of Regulation S-X in lieu of any
financial statements required by Item 8 of this Form.

ITEM 9.	 CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING
AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

NONE.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Access-Power & Co., Inc. has strict rules to follow and a Corporate Governance.

Our Director's wife of 30 years was diagnosed with Stage 1 CANCER in our 4th
QTR 2020.

ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION

Access-Power & Co., Inc. will succeed, and will come back further. On October
18, 2019 Access-Power & Co., Inc. was upgraded in tier at OTC Markets from
the grey market back to the Pink No Information Tier. We spent 11 dark
years on the OTC Grey Market. We believe
in a higher reporting standard. We will not dilute our Shareholders
in 2021. Patrick J. Jensen made a critical decision in 2018 which
enabled ACCR to get upgraded in tier. We are not going back to the
grey market.

NO WAY.

There is an SEC 15c211 Modernization Rule update coming in 2021 - expected
by September 2021. We will have 2 trys to get PINK CURRENT with OTC
Markets.
We
will be successfull in our re-application on January 24, 2021.

DO NOT PENALIZE US FOR TRYING - this spirit is ALIVE!

In August 2020, our Director PATRICK became a permanent US Disabled Citizen.

We believe that all OTC Companies in the Pink No Information tier will be
remanded
to the Expert Market ----> Where the roaches check in, and NEVER check
out - the
NEW DEATH GREY MARKET in 2021.

We spent 11 years on the grey market Cellar Boxed.

Everyone wants to know how I did it, as there are only a handful
of companies that have ever returned from the dark greys. ACCR has
accomplished the unthinkable. We have liquidity and further
transparency.

up agreement pledging never to sell or pledge to sell my restricted
stock until March 2022. At that time, I will follow all
current SEC rules and regulations with regard to Company Directors.

WE have 1 very close advisor who advises ACCR on day to day operations.
ACCR will soon announce an ADVISORY BOARD at no cost to the Company.

ITEM 11.	EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Patrick J. Jensen is the only KEY EMPLOYEE. I donate all my time
and money to the ACCR Treasury. I donate my own personaly funds to
fund the operations, as ACCR has ZERO CONVERTIBLE NOTES and ZERO

NONE.

ITEM 14.	PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES

H&R BLOCK of Muskegon. We expect only to pay 450.00 every year for
review and support of the 2020 ACCR US Tax Return. We expect to
complete our 2020 US TAX BUSINESS RETURN sometime in April 2021. We
know that there are many hurdles to bridge forward our accounting.

We need a CPA - and we are working with a consultant to bring one on board.

We need an ATTORNEY LETTER to get PINK CURRENT by our re-application
date of January 24, 2021. We have continuous bank statements from May 2018-
Present. We are in good standing, and request a re-application please to the
CURRENT INFORMATION TIER at OTC Markets.

This is a re-application to be pink current...we last traded in the
PINK SHEETS current tier over 13 years ago and on www.otcbb.com

WE MADE A FINRA DAILY LIST ON 5/6/2020 and 9/6/2018.

 CERTIFIED 

https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/ACCR/security

Our next step will be to amend our Company 10k from 2018-2020.
We also will secure a letter signed by H&R Block attesting to
verification of all monthly bank records, revenue, and expenses.
We have a 2 year plan going forward to become CURRENT REGISTERED
with the SEC.

We are hooked up to QuickBooks with our CONSULTANT
to solidify accounting in 2021.

After 2 years, we plan to get an accountant that is
registered with the PCAOB, like BDO of Grand Rapids. We will
continue to be a CURRENT REPORTING company. We believe in our plan,
and we are secure in our future. Again, as of today, December
31st, 2020...the verified outstanding share is 300,000,000 shares and at
a closing price of .0035, this represents a total Company
market value of 1,050,000.00

We value the shares our Company.

OF RISK AND,
THEREFORE, SHOULD BE CONSIDERED EXTREMELY SPECULATIVE.

You should be aware that there are many substantial risks to an investment
in our common stock. Carefully consider these risk factors, along with any
available information currently reported by the Company (of which there
are note), before you decide to invest in shares of our common stock.

If these risk factors were to occur, our business, financial condition,
results of operations or future prospects could be materially adversely
affected. If that happens, the market price for our common stock, if any,
could decline, and prospective investors would likely lose all or even
part of their investment.
