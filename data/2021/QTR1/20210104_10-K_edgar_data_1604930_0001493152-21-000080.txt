1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS. 

General
Information about Our Company 

Life
Clips, Inc. Life Clips , we, us, our, and the Company was
incorporated in Wyoming on March 20, 2013 as Blue Sky Media Corporation and its principal business was developing, financing,
producing and distributing motion pictures and related entertainment products. Following the Company s October 2, 2015 acquisition
of Klear Kapture, Inc. Klear Kapture ), the Company continued Klear Kapture s business of developing a body
camera and an auditable software solution suitable for use by law enforcement. The Company changed its name to Life Clips, Inc.
on November 3, 2015 in order to better reflect its business operations at the time. 

Recent
Developments 

On
July 11, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition (the Acquisition of all of the outstanding equity securities
of Batterfly Energy Ltd. Batterfly ), an Israel-based corporation that develops and distributes a single-use, cordless
battery under the brand name Mobeego for use with cellular phones and other mobile devices. Batterfly is now a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company. The Acquisition was completed pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 10, 2016 (the Purchase
Agreement ), among the Company, Batterfly and all of the shareholders of Batterfly, as amended. 

Following
the acquisition of Batterfly, we began to focus on developing three synergistic businesses: 

Expanding
 the Mobeego line of mobile accessories. 

Global
 Sourcing Services that includes product design, factory identification, negotiations, compliance qualification, and end-to-end
 logistics management to source products anywhere in the world. 

Sales
 and marketing services that provide an efficient path for companies to launch and market product into multi-channel retail
 and capture the maximum return on investment. 

The
Company is currently pursuing alternative business opportunities. There has been limited activity due to a delay in securing funding.
The Company is working to re-energize the business within the next 12 months. 

Products 

Our
core product is Mobeego batteries. 

Batteries 

Mobeego
consists of a one-time use, non-rechargeable, battery and a special, reusable phone adapter (plug), which is a small device that
includes the charging control circuit as well as a specific male connector that matches user device s female connector.
The Company is evaluating the resumption of selling Mobeego in two manners: 

(1) 
 Sets
 including a specific adapter and one or two emergency batteries 

(2) 
 Refill
 Batteries 

(3) 
 6
 pack of Batteries 

(4) 
 set
 including an adapter and one emergency battery for Action cameras such as Life Clips action camera. 

The
Battery (Energy Unit): 

The
Energy Unit consists of a custom designed plastic casing, shaped as a small can of energy drink, hosting a powerful lithium battery.
The energy can has a rail used to connect it to the adapter through a rail connection. This unit is designed to
be seen as the energy drink for the mobile devices . It is for a single use and is non-rechargeable. 

Adapter 

The
adapter is a small plastic device that connects to the Battery through 2 connectors and to the mobile device through the specific
connector on user s cellphone, which could be Lightning or Deck for iPhones, micro-USB for Android devices, Blackberries
and others. The adapter features an On/Off switch and a LED to indicate when it s charging. Within the adapter, there is
a smart, electronic charging circuit on a circuit board.

Sales 

We
are evaluating a sales distribution model and the viability of sales of our products through retailers directly and through distributors.
We are evaluating relationships with retailers and distributors, and our partners sales forces to map out a sales strategy
for our products and a way to work with them to merchandise our products in a compelling manner in-store, as well as assessing
a viable way to provide consumers with informative and convenient ecommerce experiences at retail partner websites. 

Direct
sales 

In
addition to the evaluation of our international sales model, we are evaluating the feasibility of selling directly to large and
small retailers in the United States, directly to some retail outlets. Elements of the plans we are evaluating include: 

Independent
 specialty retailers. Potential use of a network of location-based independent manufacturer representatives to sell our
 products to independent specialty retailers focused on action sports markets. Our representatives would provide highly personalized
 service to these retailers, including assisting with product mix planning, channel marketing and in-store merchandising, taking
 orders and providing clinics to educate retail sales personnel about Mobeego products. 

Big
 box retailers. Potential sales to large retailers with a national presence, including Amazon.com, Inc., Best Buy, Target
 Corporation and Wal-Mart, Inc. 

Mid-market
 retailers. Potential sales to retailers with a large regional or national presence, often focused on specific verticals
 such as consumer electronics, sporting goods, military, hunting and fishing and motor sports, which we refer to as our mid-market 
 channel. 

Ecommerce
 channel. Sales of our Mobeego products directly to consumers around the world through an online store. We will evaluate
 ways to drive consumers to our website through online and offline advertising, as well as marketing promotions carried out
 at tradeshows and sponsored events. 

Competition,
competitive position in the industry and methods of competition 

The
battery industry is highly competitive. The Company faces intense competition from very large, international corporations, as
well as from local and national companies. In addition, the Company faces competition from well-known companies that have large
market share. 

The
intensity of competition in the future is expected to increase and no assurance can be provided that the Company can sustain its
market position or expand its business. 

Many
of the Company s current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories, significantly
greater financial and operational resources, and name recognition, which the Company does not have. 

The
global sourcing industry is highly competitive. We face competition from very large international competitors. The competition
in the future is going to increase. 

Status
of any publicly announced new product or service 

None. 

Employees 

As
of June 30, 2020, we had no contracted employees. 

Patents
and Trademarks 

The
Company currently has a United States trademark, Serial Number 86888487, for Life Clips. The Company, pursuant to the Batterfly
acquisition, now also holds a United States trademark, Serial Number 79172000 for Mobeego, a patent in China, number 201730018307.4,
as well as two patents in Israel, numbers 002743724-0001 and 002743724-0002. Any encroachment upon the Company s proprietary
information, including the unauthorized use of its brand name, the use of a similar name by a competing company or a lawsuit initiated
either by our Company or against our Company for infringement upon proprietary information or improper use of a trademark, may
affect our ability to create brand name recognition, cause customer confusion and/or have a detrimental effect on its business
due to the cost of defending any potential litigation related to infringement. Litigation or proceedings before the U.S. or International
Patent and Trademark Offices may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade
secrets and/or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation or adverse proceeding
could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could seriously harm our business operations and/or results
of operations. 

- 5 - 

Government
Approval 

The
battery and global sourcing industries may be regulated at the federal levels, both in terms of health and safety concerns, as
well as product quality. Operation of the Company s business requires various licenses, permits and approvals. The Company
currently holds all applicable licenses and permits to operate its business, and will continue to hold all applicable permits
and licenses to continue operating its business and running its marketplace. In addition, the Company will also ensure compliance
with any additional licensing requirements that are required on an ongoing basis. 

Government
and Industry Regulation 

The
Company will be subject to local and international laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to its operations,
such as the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and Wyoming Corporation Law. It will also be subject
to common business and tax rules and regulations pertaining to the operation of its business, such as the United States Internal
Revenue Tax Code and the Wyoming State Tax Code, as well as international tax codes and shipping tariffs. The Company will also
be subject to proprietary regulations such as United States Trademark and Patent Law as it applies to the intellectual property
of third parties. The Company believes that the effects of existing or probable governmental regulations will be additional responsibilities
of the management of the Company to ensure that the Company is in compliance with securities regulations as they apply to the
Company s products as well as ensuring that the Company does not infringe on any proprietary rights of others with respect
to its products. The Company will also need to maintain accurate financial records in order to remain compliant with securities
regulations as well as any corporate tax liability it incurs.

How
We Generate Revenue 

In May 2014,
the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements of Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC,
Topic 605 Revenue Recognition. ASU 2014-09 requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods
or services. The new revenue recognition model requires identifying the contract, identifying the performance obligations, determining
the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to performance obligations and recognizing the revenue upon satisfaction
of the performance obligations. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty
of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and change in judgments, and assets
recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 can be applied either retrospectively to each prior
reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the update recognized at the date
of the initial application along with additional disclosures. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, with the option to adopt as early as December 15, 2016. The Company adopted the new revenue guidance effective
July 1, 2017. There was no material impact to the Company s consolidated financial statements or consolidated
financial statement disclosures. 

General
and administrative expenses consisted of professional service fees, and other general and administrative overhead costs. Expenses
are recognized when incurred. 

Depending
on the extent of our future growth, we may experience significant strain on our management, personnel, and information systems.
We will need to implement and improve operational, financial, and management information systems. In addition, we are implementing
new information systems that will provide better record-keeping, customer service and billing. However, there can be no assurance
that our management resources or information systems will be sufficient to manage any future growth in our business, and the failure
to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Results
of Operations 

For
the Years ended June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019 

The
Company is reporting 0 revenue for the years ended June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019. 

Cost
of goods sold for the years ended June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019 was 0. The Company had insufficient funding for the development
of products. 

Operating
expenses, which consisted of professional fees and general and administrative expenses, for the year ended June 30, 2020, were
 326,614. This compares with operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2019, of 385,369. The decrease of 58,755 in operating
expenses for the year ended June 30, 2020 is related to insufficient capital to continue operating activities, which resulted
in decreases in professional fees. 

- 9 - 

As
a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss of 10,740,327 for the year ended June 30, 2020. This compares with a net income
for the year ended June 30, 2019 of 5,264,597. The difference is primarily due to a 2019 net gain in derivatives of 6,128,517
compared to a net loss of 10,018,665 for the year ended June 30, 2020. 

In
its audited consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2020, the Company was issued an opinion by its auditors that
raised substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern based on the Company s current financial position.
Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to successfully develop
and market our products and our ability to generate revenues. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of June 30, 2020, we had cash or cash equivalents of 12,160. As of June 30, 2019, we had cash or cash equivalents of 33,774. 

Net
cash from operating activities was (21,614) for the year ended June 30, 2020. This compares to net cash from operating activities
of (49,478) for the year ended June 30, 2019. The change of (27,864) in our net cash from operating activities for the year
ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to a change in a net loss of 10,740,327 vs. net income of 5,264,597, primarily caused
by a significant swing in the derivative liability. 

Cash
flows from investing activities was 0 for the years ended June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019. 

Cash
flows from financing activities was 0 for the year ended June 30, 2020, which compares to cash flows from financing activities
of 75,000 for the year ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in our cash flows from financing activities for the year ended June
30, 2020 was due to a decrease in proceeds from convertible notes. 

We
have no present agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisitions of other businesses, products, product rights
or technologies or any other material capital expenditures. However, we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of and/or investments
in products, technologies, capital equipment or improvements or companies that complement our business and may make such acquisitions
and/or investments in the future. Accordingly, we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to finance any
such acquisitions and/or investments. We may not be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
Due to the ongoing global economic crisis, we believe it may be difficult to obtain additional financing if needed. Even if we
are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or
cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing. 

Stock
Incentive Plan 

On
April 20, 2017, the Company approved the Life Clips, Inc. 2017 Stock and Incentive Plan the Plan ). The Plan provides

the year ending June 30, 2020, all Company employment agreements with key officers did not auto-renew, as they were made with
the former CEO and deemed to be no longer pertinent. They were replaced on July 1, 2018 with a board resolution on June 2, 2020.

Going
Concern 

We
believe that the actions presently being taken to further implement the Company s business plan and generate revenues provide
the opportunity for us to continue as a going concern. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate revenues
and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. Our ability to continue as a going concern
is dependent upon our ability to further implement our business plan and generate revenues. 

The consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. 

Future
Financings 

We
will require additional financing to fund our planned operations. We currently do not have committed sources of additional financing
and may not be able to obtain additional financing particularly, if the volatile conditions of the stock and financial markets,
and more particularly the market for early development stage company stocks persist. There can be no assurance that additional
financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we
are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, if and when it is needed, we will be forced to further delay
or further scale down some or all of our activities or perhaps even cease the operations of the business. 

Since
inception we have funded our operations primarily through equity and debt financings and we expect that we will continue to fund
our operations through equity and debt financing, either alone or through strategic alliances. If we are able to raise additional
financing by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders ownership will be diluted. Obtaining commercial or other
loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. 

There
is no assurance that we will be able to maintain operations at a level sufficient for an investor to obtain a return on his, her,
or its investment in our common stock. Further, we may continue to be unprofitable. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
SEC has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial
condition and results of operations and which require us to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result
of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical
accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies that are significant to understanding
our results. 

The
following are deemed to be the most significant accounting policies affecting us. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates
and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements. The more significant estimates and assumptions
by management include among others: property and equipment, foreign currency transactions and translations, and common stock valuation.
The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions. 

Income
Taxes 

We
account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach. This process involves calculating the temporary and permanent
differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for
income tax purposes. The temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which would be recorded on our consolidated
balance sheets in accordance with ASC 740, which established financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of
income taxes. We must assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to
the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Changes in our valuation allowance
in a period are recorded through the income tax provision on the consolidated statements of operations. 

- 12 - 

From
the date of our inception we adopted ASC 740-10-30. ASC 740-10 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized
in an entity s consolidated financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes
for consolidated financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC
740-10, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that
is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not
be recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained. Additionally, ASC 740-10 provides guidance on derecognition,
classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. As a result of the implementation
of ASC 740-10, we recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits. 

Non-Cash
Equity Transactions 

Shares
of equity instruments issued for non-cash consideration are recorded at the fair value of the consideration received based on
the market value of services to be rendered, or at the value of the stock given, considered in reference to contemporaneous cash
sale of stock. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

We
apply the provisions of accounting guidance, FASB Topic ASC 825, that requires all entities to disclose the fair value of financial
instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the consolidated balance sheet, for which it
is practicable to estimate fair value, and defines fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument
could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of accounts
payable approximated carrying value due to the short maturity of the instruments, quoted market prices or interest rates which
fluctuate with market rates. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

There were no Recently
Adopted Standards. 

- 13 - 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on
Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 amends the guidance on the impairment of financial instruments. This update adds an impairment
model (known as the current expected credit losses model) that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under
the new guidance, an entity recognizes, as an allowance, its estimate of expected credit losses. In November 2018, ASU 2016-13
was amended by ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses. ASU 2018-19
changes the effective date of the credit loss standards (ASU 2016-13) to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Further, the ASU clarifies that operating lease receivables are not within the scope
of ASC 326-20 and should instead be accounted for under the new leasing standard, ASC 842. The Company does not believe that the
impact of this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In
January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill
Impairment. The amendments in this ASU simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill
impairment test and eliminating the requirement for a reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative
assessment. Instead, under this ASU, an entity would perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the
fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying
amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value; however, the loss recognized is not to exceed the total amount of goodwill
allocated to that reporting unit. In addition, income tax effects will be considered, if applicable. This ASU is effective for
fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The
Company does not believe that the impact of this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements
and related disclosures. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

Under
SEC regulations, we are required to disclose our off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
or future effect on our financial condition, such as changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. As of June 30, 2020, we have no off-balance
sheet arrangements. 

Inflation 

We
do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and 

 Stockholders
of Life Clips, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Life Clips, Inc. (the Company) as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended,
and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to
the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether
due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
As discussed in Note 3, the Company has incurred net losses and has minimal revenues. These factors, and the need for
additional financing in order for the Company to meet its business plans raises substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified with respect to that matter.

 Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements 

 June
30, 2020 and 2019 

NOTE
1. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS 

Life
Clips, Inc. (the Company was incorporated in Wyoming on March 20, 2013 as Blue Sky Media Corporation and its principal
business was developing, financing, producing and distributing motion pictures and related entertainment products. Following the
Company s October 2, 2015 acquisition of Klear Kapture, Inc. Klear Kapture ), the Company continued Klear
Kapture s business of developing a body camera and an auditable software solution suitable for use by law enforcement. The
Company changed its name to Life Clips, Inc. on November 3, 2015 in order to better reflect its business operations at the time. 

On
July 11, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition (the Acquisition of all of the outstanding equity securities
of Batterfly Energy Ltd. Batterfly ), an Israel-based corporation that develops and distributes a single-use, cordless
battery under the brand name Mobeego for use with cellular phones and other mobile devices. Batterfly is now a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company. The Acquisition was completed pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 10, 2016 (the Purchase
Agreement ), among the Company, Batterfly and all of the shareholders of Batterfly, as amended. 

The
Company is currently open to and pursuing alternative business opportunities. 

NOTE
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis
of Presentation and Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The
Company consolidates the consolidated financial statements of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and all intercompany transactions
and account balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Use
of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents For financial statement presentation purposes, the Company considers all short-term investments
with a maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Income
Tax The Company accounts for income taxes under Accounting Standards Certifications ASC 740 Income
Taxes ASC 740 ). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
to differences between the consolidated financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance
is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through
future operations. 

Basic
and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260
 Earnings Per Share ASC 260 ). ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings
per share EPS on the face of the consolidated statements of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing
net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period. If applicable, diluted earnings per share assume the conversion, exercise or issuance of all common stock instruments
such as options, warrants and convertible securities, unless the effect is to reduce a loss or increase earnings per share. Diluted
EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments The Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit
price as defined by the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements, which represents the amount that would be received
on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability, as the case may be, in an orderly transaction between market participants.
As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative
guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring
basis whereby inputs, used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. 

The
following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value: 

Level
 1 Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level
 2 Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for
 similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities;
 or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

Level
 3 Unobservable inputs reflecting the Company s assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine
 fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available. 

F- 7 

The
carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses and
interest, certain notes payable and notes payable due to related parties, approximate their fair values because of the
short maturity of these instruments. 

The
Company accounts for its derivative liabilities, at fair value, on a recurring basis under Level 3 (See Note 7). 

Embedded
Conversion Features The Company evaluates embedded conversion features within convertible debt under ASC 815 Derivatives
and Hedging to determine whether the embedded conversion feature(s) should be bifurcated from the host instrument and
accounted for as a derivative at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. If the conversion feature does not
require derivative treatment under ASC 815, the instrument is evaluated under ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other
Options for consideration of any beneficial conversion feature. 

Derivative
Financial Instruments The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or
foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments, including stock purchase warrants, to determine
if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments
that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued
at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income. 

For
option-based simple derivative financial instruments, the Company uses the Monte Carlo option-pricing model to value the derivative
instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such
instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. 

Debt
Issue Costs and Debt Discount The Company may record debt issue costs and/or debt discounts in connection with raising
funds through the issuance of debt. These costs may be paid in the form of cash, or equity (such as warrants). These costs are
amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate share
of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed. 

Stock
Based Compensation ASC 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation prescribes accounting and reporting
standards for all stock-based compensation plan payments awarded to employees, including employee stock options, restricted stock,
employee stock purchase plans and stock appreciation rights, which may be classified as either equity or liabilities. The Company
should determine if a present obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction in cash or other assets exists. A present
obligation to settle in cash or other assets exists if: (a) the option to settle by issuing equity instruments lacks commercial
substance or (b) the present obligation is implied because of an entity s past practices or stated policies. If a present
obligation exists, the transaction should be recognized as a liability otherwise, the transaction should be recognized as
equity. 

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to nonemployees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC
505-50 Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees . Measurement of share-based payment transactions with nonemployees
shall be based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received or (b) the
equity instruments issued. The fair value of the share-based payment transaction should be determined at the earlier of performance
commitment date or performance completion date. 

Recognition
of Revenues The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU No.
2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The Company recognizes
as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligations when the performance
obligation is satisfied, or as it is satisfied. The Company primarily sells disposable and recyclable cell phone batteries. The
Company s performance obligation is satisfied when the goods have been delivered, which is at a point in time. The
Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue recognized as it fulfills its
obligations under each of its agreements: 

identify
 the contract with a customer; 

identify
 the performance obligations in the contract; 

determine
 the transaction price; 

allocate
 the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and 

recognize
 revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic
842) - In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which will require lessees to recognize almost all leases on their
consolidated balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. For consolidated income statement purposes,
the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Classification will be based
on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. Lessor accounting
is similar to the current model, but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition
standard. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. The Company adopted this in Fiscal Year 2020. 

Subsequent
Events The Company follows the guidance in ASC 855 Subsequent Events for the disclosure of subsequent
events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the consolidated financial statements are issued.
Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB ASC, the Company as an SEC filer considers its consolidated financial statements issued
when they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR.

NOTE
3. UNCERTAINTY OF ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements, the Company has minimal revenues, net accumulated losses since inception and an accumulated
deficit of 29,301,198. These factors raise doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company
to continue as a going concern is dependent on management funding operating costs. The consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

NOTE
4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

At
June 30, 2020 and 2019, due to related parties was 763,050 and 463,050, respectively. This was comprised of unpaid compensation
of 580,550 to Victoria Rudman, 122,500 to William Singer, and 60,000 to Charles Adelson. 

As
of June 2, 2020, the board approved to pay these amounts by converting them to common stock. 

(1) 
 Victoria
 Rudman has accrued salary at the rate of 15,000 per month and chairman fees at the rate of 4,000 per month since July 1,
 2018. 
 
 (2) 
 William
 Singer has accrued salary at the rate of 1,000 per month and director fees at the rate of 2,500 per month since July 1,
 2018. 
 
 (3) 
 Charles
 Adelson has accrued director fees at the rate of 2,500 per month since July 1, 2018. 

NOTE
5. NOTES PAYABLE IN DEFAULT 

At
June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company had two notes payable in the amount of 530,000, with the following terms: 

1. 
 The
 Batterfly Acquisition Note required the Company to make two payments of 250,000 on October 6, 2017 and February 13, 2017.
 Upon failure to pay the payment due, the balance began to accrue at 11 interest per annum. 

2. 
 On
 July 14, 2016, the Company issued a new promissory note to NUWA Group, LLC., from which the Company received 30,000 in gross
 proceeds, has a maturity date of October 14, 2016, and bears interest at 5 per annum. This promissory note does not have
 a conversion feature.

The
Company evaluated the convertible promissory notes under ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). ASC 815
generally requires the analysis of embedded terms and features that have characteristics of derivatives to be evaluated for bifurcation
and separate accounting in instances where their economic risks and characteristics are not clearly and closely related to the
risks of the host contract. The material embedded derivative consists of the embedded conversion feature. The conversion option
bears risks of equity which were not clearly and closely related to the host debt agreement and required bifurcation. See Note
7 for further discussion. 

Debt
Discount 

The
Company recorded the debt discount to the extent of the gross proceeds raised and expensed immediately the remaining fair value
of the derivative liability, as it exceeded the gross proceeds of the note. 

The
convertible notes had a debt discount of 0 and 22,890 as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Total
amortization of debt discount amounted to 22,890 and 112,329 for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

F- 10 

NOTE
7. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

The
Company s convertible promissory notes and detachable warrants gave rise to derivative financial instruments. The notes
embodied certain terms and conditions that were not clearly and closely related to the host debt agreement in terms of economic
risks and characteristics. These terms and features consist of the embedded conversion option. Additionally, the detachable warrants
contained terms and features that gave rise to derivative liability classification. As of June 30, 2020, the Company does not
have enough authorized shares to settle all potential conversion and warrant transactions. 

The
following tables summarize the components of the Company s derivative liabilities and linked common shares as of June 30,
2020 and 2019 and the amounts that were reflected in income related to derivatives for the period ended:

Current
accounting principles that are provided in ASC 815 - Derivatives and Hedging require derivative financial instruments to
be classified in liabilities and carried at fair value with changes recorded in income. The Company has selected the Binomial
Lattice Model, which approximates the Monte Carlo Simulations, valuation technique to fair value the compound embedded derivative
because it believes that this technique is reflective of all significant assumption types, and ranges of assumption inputs, that
market participants would likely consider in transactions involving compound embedded derivatives. Such assumptions include, among
other inputs, interest risk assumptions, credit risk assumptions and redemption behaviors in addition to traditional inputs for
option models such as market trading volatility and risk-free rates. The Binomial Lattice Model technique is a level three valuation
technique because it requires the development of significant internal assumptions in addition to observable market indicators.
For instruments in which the time to expiration has expired, the Company has utilized the intrinsic value as the fair value.
The intrinsic value is the difference between the quoted market price on the valuation date and the applicable conversion price.

Authorized
Capital 

On
September 28, 2017, the Company filed Articles of Amendment authorizing 5,000,000, shares of common stock, par value 0.001 per
share (the Common Stock and 20,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value 0.001 (the Preferred Stock ).
The Board may issue shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series and fix the rights, preferences and privileges thereof, including
voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences, number of shares constituting any series or the
designation of such series, without further vote or action by the stockholders. 

F- 12 

Preferred
Stock 

Effective
May 19, 2017, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to designate 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock as Series A Preferred
Stock, with a par value of 0.001 per share (the Series A Stock ). Each share of Series A Stock ranks, with respect
to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, winding up or dissolution of the Company, the same as the common stock of the
Company, par value 0.001 per share (the Common Stock and is not entitled to any specific dividends or other distributions,
other than those declared by the Board of Directors. Each share of Series A Stock has 400 votes on any matter submitted to the
shareholders of the Company, and the Series A Stock votes together with the holders of the outstanding shares of all other capital
stock of the Company (including the Common Stock and any other series of preferred stock then outstanding), and not as a separate
class, series or voting group on any such matter. The Series A Preferred Stock is not transferrable by the holder, and may be
redeemed by the Company at any time for the par value. In the event that the holder of Series A Preferred Stock who is an employee
or officer of the Company leaves their position as an employee or officer of the Company for any reason, the Series A Preferred
Stock held by that holder will be automatically cancelled and will revert to being authorized and unissued shares of Series A
Preferred Stock. The Series A Stock is not convertible into any other class of shares of the Company. 

Stock
and Incentive Plan 

On
April 20, 2017, the Company adopted the Life Clips, Inc. 2017 Stock and Incentive Plan under which the Company may issue nonqualified
stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock grants and units, performance units and awards
of cash. A maximum of 20,000,000 shares of common stock may be issued under the plan, representing in excess of 35 of the number
of the Company s currently outstanding shares. Awards under the plan will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors,
although no awards have been made to date. Accordingly, the Company cannot currently determine the amount of awards that will
be made under the plan. 

NOTE
9. INCOME TAX PROVISION 

Income
taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the consolidated financial statements and consist of
taxes currently due. Deferred taxes relate to differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial and income
tax reporting which will be either taxable or deductible when the assets or liabilities are recovered or settled. 

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes .
The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach to calculate deferred income taxes. The asset and
liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of
temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided
to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will
not be realized.

June 30, 2020, the Company has a net operating loss carry-forward of (29,301,198) available to offset future taxable income expiring
through 2035. Utilization of future net operating losses may be limited due to potential ownership changes under Section 382 of
the Internal Revenue Code. 

In
assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or
all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent
upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management
considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies
in making this assessment. Based on consideration of these items, management has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative
to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance as of June
30, 2020. 

The
effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets at June 30, 2020 and 2019 are approximately
as follows:

The
Company had no gross unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future
periods. It has not accrued any interest or penalties associated with income taxes. The Company files income tax returns in the
United States federal jurisdiction. With few exceptions, it is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or non-U.S. income tax
authorities on tax returns filed before January 31, 2012. No tax returns are currently under examination by tax authorities. 

NOTE
10. COMMITTMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

From
time to time, the Company may be a party to other legal proceedings. Management currently believes that the ultimate resolution
of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flow.

Management s
annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

Our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management, with
the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020. Our management s evaluation of our internal control over financial
reporting was based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that as of June 30, 2020, our internal control
over financial reporting was not effective. 

The
ineffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was due to the following material weaknesses which we identified
in our internal control over financial reporting: (1) the lack of multiples levels of management review on complex accounting
and financial reporting issues, (2) a lack of adequate segregation of duties and necessary corporate accounting resources in our
financial reporting process and accounting function as a result of our limited financial resources to support hiring of personnel
and implementation of accounting systems. 

We expect to be materially dependent upon
third parties to provide us with accounting consulting services related to accounting services for the foreseeable future. We
believe this will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses related to our accounting discussed above. Until such time
as we have a chief financial officer with the requisite expertise in U.S. GAAP, there are no assurances that the material weaknesses
and significant deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures will not result in errors in our consolidated financial
statements which could lead to a restatement of those consolidated financial statements. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that
there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls 

Our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control
over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to
their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include
the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake.
Additional controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management
override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements
due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 

We
have made no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended June 30,
2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
